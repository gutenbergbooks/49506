<h1 title="">SUMMER IN THE WILDERNESS.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Saint Louis</span>, June, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The River Queen, as Saint Louis is sometimes called, is
looked upon as the threshold leading to the wild and romantic
region of the Upper Mississippi. It was founded in the
year seventeen hundred and sixty-four, by two Frenchmen,
named Laclade and Chouteau, who were accompanied by
about thirty Creoles. The first steamer which landed here
came from New Orleans in the year eighteen hundred and
nineteen; but the number now belonging here is rated at
three hundred, many of which are unsurpassed in speed and
splendor of accommodations. The population of this city
amounts to forty thousand souls. It is elevated some eighty
feet above the low-water mark of the Mississippi, and from
the river presents a handsome appearance. The old part of
the town is inhabited by a French population, and is in a
dilapidated condition; but the more modern portion is distinguished
for its handsome streets, and tastefully built mansions
and public buildings. Fronting the levee or landing
are several blocks of stone stores, which give one an idea of
the extensive business transacted here. On one occasion I
saw this wharfing ground so completely crowded with merchandise
of every possible variety, that travellers were actually
compelled to walk from the steamboats to the hotels.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
This city is the home market for all the natural productions
of a wilderness country extending in different directions for
thousands of miles, and watered by several of the largest
rivers in the world. Its growth, however, has been somewhat
retarded by the peculiar character of its original inhabitants.
The acknowledged wealth of many of its leading
men can only be equalled by their illiberality and want of
enterprise. But time is committing sad ravages among these
ancient citizens, for they are, from age and infirmities, almost
daily dropping into the place of graves. Under the benign
influence of true American enterprise, this city is rapidly
becoming distinguished for its New England character, in
spite of the retarding cause alluded to above, and the baneful
institution of Slavery. In fine, it possesses, to an uncommon
degree, all the worthy qualities which should belong
to an enlightened and eminently prosperous city.</p>
<p>There is one unique feature connected with the River
Queen, which gives it, at times, a most romantic appearance.
It is the point whence must start all distant expeditions to
the North and West, and where the treasures of the wilderness
are prepared for re-shipment to the more distant markets
of our own and foreign countries. Here, during the
spring and summer months may often be seen caravans
about to depart for California, Santa Fe, the Rocky Mountains,
and Oregon, while the sprightly step and sparkling
eye will speak to you of the hopes and anticipations which
animate the various adventurers. At one time, perhaps,
may be seen a company of toil-worn trappers entering the
city, after an absence of months, far away on the head waters
of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, where they have hunted
the beaver, the buffalo, the otter, the bear, and the deer; and
as they steal away to their several homes, from the door of
the Fur Company, where they have just rendered their account,
it does the heart good to ponder on the joys which
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
will be brought into existence by the happy return. And
the Indians, from different nations, who often visit this place,
also add greatly to the picturesque appearance of its streets.
Summoned by curiosity, they congregate here in large numbers,
and while their gaudy trappings and painted faces remind
us of the strange wild life they lead, their prowling
propensities and downcast eyes inform us of the melancholy
fact, that they are the victims of a most heartless, though
lawful oppression. This remark, by the way, reminds me
of a living picture which I lately witnessed, and will briefly
describe. It was the sunset hour, and I was returning from
a ride on the eastern bank of the great river. The western
sky was flooded with a saffron glow, in the midst of which
floated unnumbered cloud-islands, tinged with deepest gold.
Underneath lay the beautiful city, with its church-spires up-pointing
to the Christian&rsquo;s home; then passed the rushing
tide of the Mississippi ploughed by many a proud keel; and
in the foreground was a woody bluff, on the brow of which
sat a solitary Indian, humming a strangely solemn song, as
his white locks and eagle plumes waved in the evening
breeze. I asked no question of the sorrowing dreamer, but
pursued my way, pondering on the cruel destiny which has
power to make man a stranger and an exile, on the very soil
from which he sprang, and where repose the ashes of his
forgotten kindred.</p>
<p>Lover as I am of genuine art, it will not do for me to
leave this city, the sturdy child of a new and great empire,
without alluding to its treasures in this particular. The
bright particular star, who uses the pencil here, is Charles
Deas. He is a young man who left New-York about eight
years ago, for the purpose of studying his art in the wilds
west of the Mississippi. He makes this city his head-quarters,
but annually spends a few months among the Indian tribes,
familiarizing himself with their manners and customs, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
he is honorably identifying himself with the history and
scenery of a most interesting portion of the continent. The
great charm of his productions is found in the strongly marked
national character which they bear. His collection of
sketches is already very valuable. The following are a few
of the pictures which I saw in his studio, and which pleased
me exceedingly. One, called the Indian Guide, represents
an aged Indian riding in the evening twilight on a piebald
horse, apparently musing upon the times of old. The sentiment
of such a painting is not to be described, and can only
be felt by the beholder who has a passion for the wilderness.
Another, Long Jake, is the literal portrait of a celebrated
character of the Rocky Mountains. He looks like an untamed
hawk, figures in a flaming red shirt, and is mounted
on a black stallion. He is supposed to be on the ridge of a
hill, and as the sky is blue, the figure stands out in the boldest
relief. Artistically speaking, this is a most daring effort
of the pencil, but the artist has decidedly triumphed. In a
picture called Setting out for the Mountains, Mr. Deas has
represented a species of American Cockney, who has made
up his mind to visit the Rocky Mountains. He is mounted
on a bob-tailed, saucy-looking pony, and completely loaded
down with clothing, pistols, guns, and ammunition. He is accompanied
by a few covered wagons, a jolly servant to be
his right-hand man, and two dogs, which are frolicking on
the prairie ahead, and while the man directs the attention of
his master to some game, the latter shrugs his feeble shoulders,
seems to think this mode of travelling exceedingly fatiguing,
and personifies the latter end of a misspent life.
You imagine that a few months have elapsed, and, turning to
another picture, you behold our hero Returning from the
Mountains. Exposure and hardships have transformed him
into a superb looking fellow, and he is now full of life and
buoyancy, and riding with the most perfect elegance and ease
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
a famous steed of the prairies. The wagons, servant and
dogs, are now in the rear of our adventurer, who, comically
dressed with nothing but a cap, a calico shirt, and pair of
buckskin pantaloons, is dashing ahead, fearless of every danger
that may happen to cross his path. These pictures completely
epitomize a personal revolution which is constantly
taking place on the frontiers. One of our artist&rsquo;s more ambitious
productions, represents the daring feat of Captain
Walker, during a recent memorable battle in Mexico. The
story is that the Captain, who happened to be alone on a
plain, had his horse killed from under him, and was himself
wounded in the leg. Supposing, as was the case, that the
Mexican savage would approach to take his scalp, he feigned
himself dead, as he lay upon his horse, and as his enemy
was about to butcher him, he fired and killed the rascal on
the spot, and seizing the reins of his enemy&rsquo;s horse, he
mounted him and rode into his own camp. In the picture
Walker is in the act of firing. But the picture upon which
Mr. Deas&rsquo;s fame will probably rest, contains a large number
of figures, and represents the heroism of Captain James
Clarke, who, when about to be murdered by a council of Indians
at North-Bend, threw the war-belt in the midst of the
savages, with a defying shout, and actually overwhelmed
them with astonishment, thereby saving his own life and
those of his companions. This picture is true to history in
every particular, and full of expression.</p>
<p>But enough about these productions of art. I am bound
to the fountain head of the Mississippi, and feel impatient to
be with nature in the wilderness. Before concluding this
chapter, however, I will describe a characteristic incident
which I met with in Saint Louis.</p>
<p>I had been taking a lonely walk along the banks of the
Mississippi, and, in fancy, revelling amid the charms of this
great western world, as it existed centuries ago. My mind
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
was in a dreamy mood, and as I re-entered the city the
hum of business fell like discord on my ear. It was the
hour of twilight and the last day of the week, and the citizens
whom I saw seemed anxious to bring their labors to a
close that they might be ready for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>While sauntering leisurely through a retired street, I
was startled from a waking dream, by the sound of a deep-toned
bell, and, on lifting my eyes, I found that I stood
before the Catholic cathedral. I noticed a dim light through
one of the windows, and as the gates were open, I remembered
that it was the vesper hour, and entered the church.
The inner door noiselessly swung to, and I found myself
alone, the spectator of a most impressive scene. A single
lamp, hanging before the altar, threw out a feeble light,
and so feeble was it, that a solemn gloom brooded throughout
the temple. While a dark shadow filled the aisles and remote
corners, the capitals of the massive pillars on either
side were lost in a still deeper shade. From the ceiling
hung many a gorgeous chandelier, which were now content
to be eclipsed by the humble solitary lamp. Scriptural
paintings and pieces of statuary were on every side, but I
could discern that Christ was the centre of attraction in all.
Over, and around the altar too, were many works of art,
together with a multitudinous array of sacred symbols. Just
in front of these, and in the centre of the mystic throne,
hung the lonely lamp, which seemed to be endowed with a
thinking principle, as its feeble rays shot out into the surrounding
darkness. That part of the cathedral where
towered the stupendous organ, was in deep shadow, but I
knew it to be there by the faint glistening of its golden
pipes: as to the silence of the place, it was perfectly death-like
and holy. I chanced to heave a sigh, and that very
sigh was not without an echo. The distant hum of life,
alone convinced me that I was in a living world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>But softly! A footstep now breaks upon the silence! A
priest in a ghost-like robe, is passing from one chancel door
to another. Another footstep! and lo! a woman, clothed in
black, with her face completely hidden in a veil, passes up
an aisle and falls upon her knees in prayer. She has come
here to find consolation in her widowhood. And now,
slowly tottering along, comes a white-haired man, and he,
too, falls in the attitude of prayer. With the pleasures of
this world he is fully satisfied, and his thoughts are now
taken up with that strange pilgrimage, whence travellers
never return, and upon which he feels he must soon enter.</p>
<p>Other life-sick mortals, have also entered the sanctuary,
offered up their evening prayer, and mingled with the tide
of life once more. But again the front door slowly opens,
and a little negro boy, some seven years of age, is standing
by my side. What business has he here,&mdash;for surely this
offspring of a slave, and a slave himself, cannot be a religious
devotee? I take back that thought. I have wronged
the child. The Spirit of God must tabernacle in his heart,
else he would not approach the altar with such deep reverence.
Behold him, like little Samuel of old, calling upon
the Invisible in prayer! What a picture! Twilight in a
superb cathedral, and the only worshipper a child and a
slave!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Rock Island</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>I have sailed upon the Mississippi, from the point where
it empties into the Gulf of Mexico, all the way up to the little
Lake which gives it existence, and I now intend to record a
description of its scenery and prominent characteristics.
The literal meaning of the Chippeway word Meseeseepe is&mdash;water
every where&mdash;and conveys the same idea which has
been translated&mdash;father of waters. When we remember the
immense extent of the valley watered by this stream and its
hundred tributaries, this name must be considered as singularly
expressive.</p>
<p>That portion of the river known as the Lower Mississippi,
extends from New Orleans to the mouth of the Missouri, a
distance of about twelve hundred miles. As the highway
for a multitudinous number of steam vessels of every size
and character, it is of incalculable importance, not only to
this country but to the world; but with regard to its scenery,
it affords little of an interesting character. Excepting a
few rocky bluffs found some distance below Saint Louis, and
in the vicinity of Natchez, both shores of the river are low,
level, and covered with dense forests of cotton-wood and
cypress, where the panther and the wolf roam in perfect freedom,
and the eagle swoops upon its prey undisturbed by the
presence of man. The banks are of an alluvial character,
and as the current is exceedingly rapid, the course of the
river is constantly changing. You might travel a hundred
miles without finding a place sufficiently secure to land;
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
and the water is always so very muddy that a tumbler full
will always yield half an inch of the virgin soil. The surface
of the stream is never placid, but for ever turbulent and
full of eddies and whirlpools, as if its channel were composed
of a continued succession of caverns. Snags and sawyers
abound throughout its whole extent. They are taken from
the shore by the rushing tide and planted in the channel
quite as rapidly as the snag-vessels can extricate them from
their dangerous positions.</p>
<p>The Lower Mississippi (always excepting the still more
frantic Missouri) is probably the most dangerous and least
interesting river in the world to navigate. When not in
actual danger, you are likely to be so far removed from it,
high and dry on a sand bar, that the annoyance, like a certain
period in our national history, has a tendency to try
men&rsquo;s souls. The following picture of an actual scene on
this portion of the great river, may be looked upon as characteristic
of the whole. On your right is a series of rocky
bluffs, covered with a stunted growth of trees, before you an
expanse of water ten miles long and two wide, on your left an
array of sand bars and islands, where lie imbedded the wrecks
of some fifty steamboats, and in the more remote distance
a belt of thickly wooded bottom land. On the water, passing
to and fro, are a number of steamers, and immediately in the
foreground a solitary sawyer and the hull of a sunken steam-boat.
This is the spot which has been rightly named the
Grave Yard, for hundreds of souls at different times have
passed from thence into eternity. When I left the turbid
and unruly bosom of the Lower Mississippi, I felt towards it
as a person would naturally feel towards an old tyrant who
had vainly striven to destroy him in his savage wrath. I
should remark in passing that the bottom lands of this river
are not wholly without inhabitants; occasionally a lonely
log cabin meets the eye, which is the only home of a miserable
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
being who obtains his living by supplying the steamers
with wood. Nailed to a stump before one of these squatter
residences, which stood in the centre of a small clearing, I
saw a board with the following inscription,&mdash;&ldquo;This <i>farm</i> for
sale&mdash;price $1 50.&rdquo; Though I could not help laughing at
the unintentional wit of that sentence, it told me a melancholy
tale of poverty, intemperance, and sickness, which are
too often identified with the dangers of this wilderness.</p>
<p>I would now speak of the Upper Mississippi, and I only
regret that I cannot strike the poet&rsquo;s lyre, and give to this
&ldquo;parent of perpetual streams&rdquo; an undying hymn of praise.
The moment that you pass the mouth of the Missouri on your
way up the Father of Waters, you seem to be entering an
entirely new world, whose every feature is &ldquo;beautiful
exceedingly.&rdquo; The shores now slope with their green verdure
to the very margin of the water, which is now of a deep
green color, perfectly clear, and placid as the slumber of a
babe. My first view of this spot was at the twilight hour,
when the time was holy, and every object that met my gaze
seemed to have been baptized with an immortal loveliness.
Over the point where the sun had disappeared, floated a
cavalcade of golden clouds, and away to the eastward rolled
on, along her clear, blue pathway, the bright, full moon, and
now and then a trembling star,&mdash;the whole completely mirrored
in the bosom of the softly flowing but ever murmuring
stream. On my right lay a somewhat cultivated shore; on
my left a flock of islands, whose heavy masses of foliage
rested upon the water; and in the distance was the pleasant
and picturesque town of Alton, with its church spires speaking
of hope and heaven. No living creatures met my gaze,
save a wild duck and her brood gliding into their shadowy
home, and an occasional night-hawk as he shot through the
upper air after his living food; and no sound fell upon my
ear, but the jingling of a distant cow-bell and the splash of a
leaping sturgeon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Another picture which makes me remember with unalloyed
pleasure this portion of the Mississippi, was a scene
that I witnessed early in the morning. The sky was without
a cloud, and the pleasant sunshine fell upon my cheek,
like the kiss of one whom we dearly love. On either side
of me was a row of heavily timbered islands, whose lofty
columns, matted vines, and luxuriant undergrowth of trees,
told me of a soil that was rich beyond compare but seldom
trodden by the foot of man; and in the distance was an open
vista, beautified by other islands, and receding to the sky.
Now, unnumbered swallows were skimming over the water,
uttering a shrill chirp; then, the cry of a disappointed blue
jay would grate upon the ear; now, a boblink and black-bird
held a noisy conversation, and then the croak of a raven
would descend from the top of some dead tree; now the mocking-bird,
the dove, the red and blue-bird, the robin and the
sparrow favored me with a chorus of their own, while the
whistle of the quail and the lark would occasionally break
out to vary the natural oratorio. And to cap the climax, an
occasional flock of ducks might be seen, startled away by
our approach, also a crane feeding in a cluster of trees, or a
bold fish-hawk pursuing his prey, while the senses were
almost oppressed by the fragrance of blowing flowers, which
met the eye on every side.</p>
<p>By multiplying the above two scenes almost indefinitely,
and tinging them with the ever varying hues and features of
the pleasant summer time, and by fancying on either bank
of the river an occasional thriving village, &ldquo;like sunshine
in a shady place,&rdquo; you will have a very good idea of the
Mississippi scenery between the mouth of the Missouri and
the Lower Rapids. These are twelve miles long, and the
first on the river which impede its navigation. The water,
during the dry season varies from two to four feet in depth
on these rapids, but the channel is so very crooked that even
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
the smaller steamers with difficulty find a passage. Below
this point the eye of the traveller is occasionally delighted
by a fine prairie landscape, but the following picture may be
looked upon as a pretty accurate epitome of the scenery between
Nauvoo at the head of the Rapids, and Rock Island.
It was the noontide hour of one of those heavenly days which
occasionally make very happy the universal human world.
My own heart, which had been darkened by the shadows of
human life, was made joyous by its dazzling loveliness. The
sunshine slept upon the quiet landscape, as sweetly as if the
world had never known a deed of sin, while every object
which composed the scene performed its secret ministry of
good. It was just such a day as William Herbert has made
immortal in the following words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,</p>
<p class="t">The bridal of the earth and sky;</p>
<p class="t0">The dew will weep thy fall to-night,</p>
<p class="t">For thou must die.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At my feet flowed the tranquil waters of the superb river,
from whose very margin receded a perfectly level prairie,
which soon lost itself, in a rolling country, whose motionless
billows receded to the far horizon. On my extreme left lay
a range of wood-crowned and dreary looking hills, and on
my right a solitary bluff which was as smooth on every side
as the most highly cultivated lawn. The atmosphere was
soft and of a rosy hue, and made me long for the wings of a
dove that I might float away upon its bosom in a dream of
bliss. Flowers of loveliest hue and sweetest fragrance were
on every side; and the only sound that fell upon my ear
was a hum of insect wings. On the bluffs already mentioned
a large herd of deer were quietly cropping their food;
and in the air high towards the zenith was floating in his
pride of freedom, an immense eagle, the seeming monarch
of the western world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Rock Island, whence I date this paper, and which lies in
the river midway between the villages of Davenport and
Rock Island, is one of the most picturesque points I have yet
seen during my journey. It is literally speaking a rocky
island, and is surmounted by the dilapidated walls of an ancient
fortress, and was, in former days, the scene of many a
struggle between the red man and his <i>brotherly</i> oppressor.
But the place is greatly changed. Where once the gayly
dressed officer quaffed his wine cup at the midnight hour, the
lonely shriek of the owl is now heard even until the break
of day; and the rat, the toad, and the spider have usurped
the place where once the soldier hummed his thoughtless
song, or was heard the roar of his artillery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Rock Island</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Starved Rock is the unpoetical name of a singular spot
on the Illinois river about sixty miles east of this place, and
eight miles south of Ottawa. It is a rocky bluff, rising from
the margin of the stream to the height of more than a hundred
feet, and is only separated from the main land by a
narrow chasm. Its length might probably measure two
hundred and fifty feet. Its sides are perpendicular, and
there is only one point where it can be ascended, and that is
by a narrow stair-like path. It is covered with many a cone-like
evergreen, and, in summer, encircled by luxuriant grape
and ivy vines, and clusters of richly colored flowers. It is
undoubtedly the most conspicuous and beautiful pictorial
feature of the sluggish and lonely Illinois, and is associated
with the final extinction of the Illinois tribe of Indians. The
legend, which I listened to from the lips of a venerable Indian
trader, is as follows.</p>
<p>Many years ago, the whole region lying between Lake
Michigan and the Mississippi was the home and dominion of
the Illinois Indians. For them alone did the buffalo and
antelope range over its broad prairies; for them did the
finest of rivers roll their waters into the lap of Mexico, and
bear upon their bosoms the birchen canoe, as they sought to
capture the wild water fowl; and for them alone did the
dense forests, crowding upon these streams, shelter their unnumbered
denizens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In every direction might be seen the smoke of Indian
wigwams curling upwards to mingle with the sunset clouds,
which told them tales of the spirit land.</p>
<p>Years passed on, and they continued to be at ease in
their possessions. But the white man from the far east,
with the miseries which have ever accompanied him in his
march of usurpation, began to wander into the wilderness,
and trouble to the poor red man was the inevitable consequence.
The baneful &ldquo;fire water,&rdquo; which was the gift of
civilization, created dissensions among the savage tribes,
until in process of time, and on account of purely imaginary
evils, the Pottowattomies from Michigan determined to make
war upon the Indians of Illinois. Fortune, or rather destiny,
smiled upon the oppressors, and the identical rock in question
was the spot that witnessed the extinction of an aboriginal
race.</p>
<p>It was the close of a long siege of cruel warfare, and the
afternoon of a day in the delightful Indian summer. The
sunshine threw a mellow haze upon the prairies, and tinged
the multitudinous flowers with deepest gold; while, in the
shadow of the forest islands, the doe and her fawn reposed in
perfect quietness, lulled into a temporary slumber by the
hum of the grasshopper and wild bee. The wilderness
world wore the aspect of a perfect sabbath. But now, in
the twinkling of an eye, the delightful solitude was broken
by the shrill whoop and dreadful struggle of bloody conflict
upon the prairies and in the woods. All over the country
were seen the dead bodies of the ill-fated Illinois, when it
was ordered by Providence that the concluding skirmish
between the hostile parties should take place in the vicinity
of Starved Rock.</p>
<p>The Pottowattomies numbered near three hundred warriors,
while the Illinois tribe was reduced to about one hundred,
who were mostly aged chiefs and youthful heroes&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
more desperate fighters having already perished, and the
women and children of the tribe having already been massacred
and consumed in their wigwams. The battle was
most desperate between the unequal parties.</p>
<p>The Illinois were about to give up all for lost, when, in
their frenzy, they gave a defying shout, and retreated to the
rocky bluff. From this, it was an easy matter to keep back
their enemies, but alas! from that moment they were to
endure unthought-of suffering, to the delight of their baffled,
yet victorious enemies.</p>
<p>And now to describe in words the scene that followed
and was prolonged for several days, were utterly impossible.
Those stout-hearted Indians, in whom a nation was about to
become extinct, chose to die upon their strange fortress, by
starvation and thirst, rather than surrender themselves to the
scalping-knife of their exterminators. And, with a few exceptions,
this was the manner in which they did perish.
Now and then, indeed, a desperate man would lower himself,
hoping thereby to escape, but a tomahawk would cleave
his brain before he touched the ground or water.</p>
<p>Day followed day, and those helpless captives sat in
silence, and gazed imploringly upon their broad beautiful
lands, while hunger was gnawing into their very vitals.
Night followed night, and they looked upon the silent stars,
and beyond, to the home of the Great Spirit, but they murmured
not at his decree. And if they slept, in their dreams
they once more played with their little children, or held converse
with their wives, and roamed the woods and prairies
in perfect freedom. When morning dawned it was but the
harbinger of another day of agony; but when the evening
hour came, a smile would sometimes brighten up a haggard
countenance, for the poor, unhappy soul, through the eye of
an obscure faith, had caught a glimpse of the spirit land.
Day followed day, and the last lingering hope was utterly
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
abandoned. Their destiny was sealed, and no change for
good could possibly take place, for the human blood-hounds
who watched their prey, were utterly without mercy. The
feeble, white-haired chief crept into a thicket and there
breathed his last. The recently strong-bodied warrior, uttering
a protracted but feeble yell of exultation, hurled his tomahawk
upon some fiend below, and then yielded himself up to
the pains of his condition. The lithe form of the soft-eyed
youth parted with its strength, and was compelled to totter,
fall upon the earth and die. Ten weary, weary days passed
on, and the strongest man and last of his race was numbered
with the dead:&mdash;and a glorious banquet was presented to the
eagle and the raven.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Rock Island</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>On my way up the Mississippi, I tarried a few hours at
the far-famed city of Nauvoo: and when I resumed my
course, I felt like one just awakened from an incomprehensible
dream. Surely, surely Fanaticism is a most foul fiend,
and we ought to rejoice with exceeding joy that He who
ruleth the armies of heaven, is yet the protector of earth,
and its inhabitants, and will not leave all mankind alone to
the mercy of their idols.</p>
<p>The Mormon City occupies an elevated position, and, as
approached from the south, appears capable of containing a
hundred thousand souls. But its gloomy streets bring a most
melancholy disappointment. Where lately resided no less
than twenty-five thousand people, there are not to be seen
more than about five hundred; and these, in mind, body and
purse, seem to be perfectly wretched. In a walk of about
ten minutes, I counted several hundred chimneys, which
were all at least that number of families had left behind
them, as memorials of their folly, and the wickedness of
their persecutors. When this city was in its glory, every
dwelling was surrounded with a garden, so that the corporation
limits were uncommonly extensive; but now all the
fences are in ruin, and the lately crowded streets actually
rank with vegetation. Of the houses left standing, not more
than one out of every ten is occupied, excepting by the
spider and the toad. Hardly a window retained a whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
pane of glass, and the doors were broken, and open, and
hingeless. Not a single laughing voice did I hear in the
whole place, and the lines of suffering and care seemed to be
imprinted on the faces of the very children who met me in
the way. I saw not a single one of those numerous domestic
animals, which add so much to the comforts of human life;
and I heard not a single song even from the robin and the
wren, which are always so sure to build their nests about the
habitations of man. Aye, the very sunshine, and the pleasant
passing breeze, seemed both to speak of sin, sorrow, and utter
desolation.</p>
<p>Yet, in the centre of this scene of ruins, stands the
Temple of Nauvoo, which is unquestionably one of the finest
buildings in this country. It is built of limestone, quarried
within the limits of the city, in the bed of a dry stream, and
the architect, named Weeks, and every individual who labored
upon the building were Mormons. It is one hundred and
twenty-eight feet in length, eighty feet wide, and from the
ground to the extreme summit it measures two hundred and
ninety-two feet. It is principally after the Roman style of
architecture, somewhat intermixed with Grecian and Egyptian.
It has a portico, with three Roman archways. It is
surrounded with pilasters; at the base of each is carved a
new moon, inverted, while the capital of each is formed of
an uncouth head, supported by two hands holding a trumpet.
Directly under the tower in front is this inscription, in golden
letters: &ldquo;<i>The House of the Lord. Built by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Commenced April 6th,
1841. Holiness to the Lord.</i>&rdquo; In the basement room, which
is paved with brick, and converges to the centre, is a Baptismal
Font, supported by twelve oxen, large as life, the
whole executed in solid stone. Two stairways lead into
it, from opposite directions, while on either side are two
rooms for the recording clerks, and, all around, no less than
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
twelve preparation rooms besides. On the first floor are
three pulpits, and a place for the choir; and on either side
eight Roman windows. Over the prophet&rsquo;s pulpit, or throne,
is this inscription: &ldquo;<i>The Lord has beheld our sacrifice:
come after us.</i>&rdquo; Between the first and second floors are two
long rooms, appropriated to the patriarchs, which are lighted
with eight circular windows each. The room of the second
floor, in every particular, is precisely like that of the first.
Around the hall of a spacious attic are twelve small rooms,
with circular windows and a massive lock on each door. At
the two front corners of the edifice are two winding stairways,
which meet at the base of the tower and lead to the summit,&mdash;while
the roof of the main building is arranged for a place of
promenade; and the walls of the noble edifice vary from
four to six feet in thickness.</p>
<p>Estimating the manual labor at the usual prices of the
day, it is said that the cost of this Temple was about
$800,000. The owners now offer to sell it for $200,000, but
it will be a long time, I fancy, before a purchaser is found.</p>
<p>The Mormon, who took me over the Temple, and gave
me the above information, was nearly broken hearted. Like
the majority of his brethren, remaining in the city, he was
without money, and without friends, and yet, it was to be his
destiny, in a few days, to push his way into the wilderness,
with a large family depending upon him for support. It was
in a most melancholy tone, indeed, that he spoke to me the
following words: &ldquo;Mine, sir, is a hard, hard lot. What if
my religion is a false one, if I am sincere, is it not cruel, in
the extreme, for those, who call themselves the only true
church, to oppress me and my people as they have done?
My property has been stolen from me, and my dwelling been
consumed; and now, while my family is dependent upon a
more fortunate brother for support, my little children cannot
go into the streets without being pelted with stones, and my
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
daughters cannot go to the well after a pail of water, without
being insulted by the young and <i>noble</i> among our persecutors.
I do not deserve this treatment. I am not a scoundrel
or a foreigner;&mdash;far, far from the truth is this supposition.
My grandfather, sir, was killed at the battle of
Yorktown, as an officer of the glorious Revolution; my own
father, too, was also an American army officer during the
last war; and all my kindred have ever been faithful to the
upright laws of the government. Knowing, therefore, these
things to be true, and knowing, too, that I am an honest man,
it is very hard to be treated by my fellow countrymen as a
&lsquo;vagabond.&rsquo; O, I love this sacred Temple, dearly, and it
makes me weep to think that I must so soon leave it to the
tender mercies of the <i>Christian</i> world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus far had this poor man proceeded, when his utterance
was actually choked with tears,&mdash;and I was glad of it,
for my own heart was affected by his piteous tale. I gave
him a dollar for his trouble, when he was called to attend a
new arrival of visitors, and I was left alone in the belfry of
the Temple.</p>
<p>Then it was that I had an opportunity to muse upon the
superb panorama which met my gaze upon every side. I
was in a truly splendid temple,&mdash;that temple in the centre of
a desolate city,&mdash;and that city in the centre of an apparently
boundless wilderness. To the east lay in perfect beauty the
grand Prairie of Illinois, reaching to the waters of Michigan;
to the north and south faded away the winding Mississippi;
and on the west, far as the eye could reach, was spread out
a perfect sea of forest land, entering which, I could just distinguish
a caravan of exiled Mormons, on their line of march
to Oregon and California. As before remarked, when I went
forth from out the massy porches of the Mormon Temple, to
journey deeper into the wilderness, I felt like one awakened
from a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Prairie Du Chien</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Just above Rock Island are the Upper Rapids of the Mississippi,
which extend some fifteen miles and have a fall of
twenty-seven feet. They made a deep impression upon my
mind, because it was there that our steamboat swung upon a
rock for some thirty hours, and where, soon as we were
clear, we ran into a downward-bound steamer, and settled
her to the bottom;&mdash;but fortunately no lives were lost. I
noticed on these and the Lower Rapids a certain fly or miller,
which is found at the evening hour flying about in immense
numbers. They are called the Mormon fly, and I was told
were found on these rapids alone, and that wherever they
alight, there they remain, if not disturbed, until they <i>die</i>.</p>
<p>Soon after we had passed these rapids I enjoyed another
prairie scene, which was even more superb than the one I
have already attempted to describe. On this occasion the
bank in the foreground was covered with grass that must
have been at least six feet high, and the only living creatures
that I saw were a beautiful doe and her fawn&mdash;quenching
their thirst in the limpid stream.</p>
<p>The Illinois side of the Mississippi, between the Upper
Rapids and the Lefevre river which leads you to Galena, is
characterized by an extensive range of fantastic bluffs and
isolated rocks. Covered as they are with vines and mosses,
they present the appearance of ancient ruins, and it requires
no great stretch of the imagination to discover towers and
turrets of ancient castles, fortress walls that have been partly
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
battered down, and solitary pillars rising in gloomy grandeur,
as if to preach a salutary lesson to the passing traveller, upon
the ravages of time. This same kind of singular scenery
ornaments the river in the vicinity of Dubuque (which like
Galena is some distance from the Mississippi), and extends
as far as Prairie Du Chien, only, as you ascend, the bluffs
become more lofty and imposing. On the summit of one of
the most beautiful of these bluffs is a small cabin and a
large wooden cross, where the French trader and miner Dubuque
was buried&mdash;according to his own request, and in a
coffin made of solid lead.</p>
<p>Prairie Du Chien is undoubtedly one of the most interesting
and beautiful places on the Mississippi. It takes its
name from the fact that it was once the camping place of a
Fox Indian Chief, whose name was&mdash;<i>The Dog</i>. The prairie
extends along the river for about ten miles; on the one hand
it slopes gently down to the river, and on the other is bounded
by a range of bluffs, which are some five hundred feet high,
and exceedingly picturesque. The houses that shelter the
inhabitants of this place are planted without any order, but
as it is one of our more ancient trading posts, there is a rude
and romantic appearance about them which is quite refreshing.
Here, in the form of an isolated square, lie the barracks
of Fort Crawford, where the discordant sounds of the drum
and the shrill whistle of the fife are often heard; while in
another part of the plain are the ruins of an old fortress almost
level with the ground. Now a lonely Catholic church
is seen holding forth its gilded cross; and now, the store of
the Indian trader is surrounded with a herd of Winnebagoe
Indians, who resort here for the purposes of trade. The territory
of this tribe lies directly on the opposite side of the
Mississippi, where the eye is again gratified by a range of
wood-covered bluffs, rising directly from the margin of the
stream. From the regular lines of naked strata which extend
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
along the sides of all the bluffs in this vicinity, it is evident
that the spot called Prairie Du Chien was formerly the
bed of the Mississippi, but how many centuries ago this was
the case, it is impossible to imagine. And yet if this conclusion
is correct, and we remember that there are hundreds
of similar prairies as well as bottom lands on the Mississippi,
we must also conclude that this stream is now a mere rivulet
to what it was in the times of old.</p>
<p>On the bluffs, in the immediate vicinity of Prairie Du
Chien, are some of the most remarkable of those strange
memorials of a forgotten race which have yet been discovered
in our country. Like those of Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri,
and Illinois, those of the more northern wilderness
will long continue to puzzle the antiquarian, and furnish
food for the poet and the moralist. Here the mounds,
trenches, and parapets are found connected in one series of
works, which seem to have been used for military purposes.
Deep under the surface of the ground, tomahawks of brass
(differing materially from those now in use) have been
found; and stories are told of gigantic skeletons having
been disinterred in the neighbourhood. The only things
which throw any light upon these singular ruins, are the
uncouth and unsatisfactory legends of the Indians, who tell
us that a race of white giants were once the possessors of
the soil which they have inherited from their warlike and
victorious ancestors. These vestiges of an extinct race,
&ldquo;lie in their sunless chambers like the spirits of the past,
as if in mockery of an age which arrogates to itself the
term of an age of light. They will probably remain for
ever a signal rebuke upon the learning of modern times, assuming,
as it does, the pride of universal knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this place I met and had a long conversation with an
Indian trader, who had lived in the wilderness for more
than half a century. He gave me an interesting account
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
of the battle of Bad Axe, at which he was present. This
spot lies some distance below Prairie Du Chien, and received
its name from an Indian, who was killed and buried
there at an early day. The trader told me that the word
<i>battle</i> was not the right one to use in speaking of that conclusion
of the Black Hawk War;&mdash;it was a cruel <i>massacre</i>.
The poor Indians were crossing the river (as they had been
for days) with all possible despatch, when they were overtaken
by a force of three thousand of our well-armed soldiers.
The surprise caused great consternation among the Indians;
all who could, made their escape, and the leader of <i>this
crowd</i> was Black Hawk himself. Six of our people alone
were killed: and <i>nine-tenths</i> of the two hundred red-skins
slain, were <i>women</i> and <i>children</i>. The famished condition of
the <i>enemy</i> on that occasion must have been melancholy
indeed. My old friend told me, that among the scenes
which he witnessed on the ground after this massacre, was
a dead child, with the meatless bone of a young colt&rsquo;s leg,
grasped firmly in its little hand;&mdash;it had died of starvation
while clinging to the body of its murdered mother. And
this is a portion of the payment that our Government has
ever been in the habit of awarding to the poor Indian, for the
splendid territories which were his only inheritance.</p>
<p>The Winnebagoes are about the only Indians who visit
Prairie Du Chien for purposes of traffic; formerly however,
it was the congregating place for the nations which lived upon
the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, as well as those upon the head
waters of the Mississippi. The Winnebagoes were once
almost as numerous as the leaves upon the trees, but the nation
has been so far reduced that only about three thousand
now remain. And a more unhappy people do not exist upon
the continent,&mdash;warriors, women and children are all apparently
broken hearted. In olden times they were a race of
brave men and beautiful women, but now they prowl among
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
their native hills a brotherhood of vagabonds, exceedingly
poor and universally despised. And yet the white man who
was the author of all this misery counts his gold, and congratulates
himself with the idea that he is a Christian.</p>
<p>But I am wandering from what I was about to record,
viz., the history of a visit to the lodge of Winneshic, head
chief of the Winnebagoes. The business which had brought
the old man to the Prairie, was, to exchange the skin of a
recently captured bear, for a small bag of flour and some ammunition.
I had made him a present of tobacco, (which is
about the only currency that a traveller can make use of in
the wilderness,) and when it was intimated to him that I should
be pleased to visit his lodge, he immediately pressed me to
become his guest, which invitation was duly accepted. He
had come to the Prairie alone, in a small wooden canoe, in
which, at the appointed hour, I seated myself and away we
started up the Mississippi. With the language of my old
friend I was partially acquainted, and this, with my knowledge
of the Indian character, enabled me to carry on a respectable
conversation. The old man told me that I must
keep very quiet in my seat, as he thought me a novice in canoe
navigation; whereupon I seized a paddle and feathered it a
few moments in a style worthy of the chief himself, which
not only surprised, but actually delighted him. After a quiet
sail of about an hour, during which time I enjoyed some of
the finest scenery in the world, and one of the balmiest sunsets
I ever beheld, the canoe suddenly turned into the mouth
of a little creek, and I was landed at the threshold of my
companion&rsquo;s lodge. It was made of buffalo skins and shaped
like a sugar loaf. It stood upon a plot of level ground, in
the centre of a brotherhood of elms, and at the foot of an
abrupt hill. It was so far elevated as to command a southern
view of the Mississippi, extending at least a dozen miles,&mdash;the
river meanwhile making two or three magnificent
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
sweeps as if in honor of the beautiful islands which rested
like jewels on its peaceful bosom.</p>
<p>The extent of Winneshic&rsquo;s family I was unable to learn,
but the only individuals whom I saw at his lodge were his
wife, a couple of fine looking boys and a little girl. They
were all glad to see me, and treated me with marked politeness.
I was invited to a seat upon the handsomest mat in the
lodge, and while the chief sat by my side smoking his pipe
and entertaining me with the strange wild stories of his life,
the wife busied herself in finishing a pair of moccasons, while
the children were cooking a wilderness supper. That supper
consisted of boiled fish, a roasted duck, and a piece of
dough about half baked, all of which we ate with our fingers,
and without a particle of salt.</p>
<p>After the repast was ended I thought it my turn to entertain
my friends, and for this purpose had brought my portfolio
of sketches, which were carefully examined by the light
of a blazing fire. Some of the scenes I had sketched were
recognized by the whole family, and caused them to look with
perfect wonder upon my supposed talent and upon the lead
pencil which I also exhibited to them. Their astonishment
amused me exceedingly, and I greatly increased it by sketching
a profile of the chief and his better-half. It so happened
that I was successful in my attempt, and when I presented
the sketches to the individuals represented, they ransacked
every nook and corner of their lodge for something to give
me in return. The chief handed me a beautiful pipe from the
red stone quarry, while the wife presented me with the most
fantastic pair of moccasons in her possession; the little girl
gave me a cake of maple sugar, and one of the boys presented
me with an eagle&rsquo;s plume, and the other with a bow
and arrows.</p>
<p>It was near midnight before I was suffered to lie down to
rest, but before taking this step I emerged from the wigwam
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
for the purpose of looking upon the Mississippi at that hour.
And a lovely sight indeed was it my privilege to behold.
The moon was sweeping across her cloudless field of blue,
a beautiful but impatient queen, while an occasional star
gazed upward from its watchtower, as if in admiration of
the heaven-born spectacle. All the hills and islands were
in deep shadow, and before me, far as the eye could reach,
lay exposed the windings of the stream, which was brighter
than a shield of burnished steel. So very still was the air
around, that you might now hear the shrill note of some
frightened deer far away upon the hillside, and now the
scream of a lonely loon, the splashing of a leaping fish, and
the rippling of the rivulet at my feet, which glided into the
bosom of its parent stream through a cluster of tall reeds.
With this picture and its manifold associations deeply fixed
in my mind, I re-entered the lodge, threw myself upon a
mat in the midst of my Indian friends, and was soon in a
deep sleep.</p>
<p>I arose, on the following morning, at an early hour, and
after partaking of a breakfast of boiled fish, I entered, with
the chief, into his canoe, and in forty minutes was at my
quarters in Prairie Du Chien.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Prairie Du Chien</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The lead region of the Mississippi occupies not far from
one hundred square miles. The two principal towns are
Galena and Dubuque, which are both handsome and flourishing.
The original possessors of this land were the Sac
Fox Indians, who used to sell to the white settlers on the
frontier the ore which they often found upon the surface of
their soil. The first white man who went into the mining
business, (which was on a small scale,) was Dubuque. He
was supposed to possess a cure for the bite of the rattlesnake.
He became a great favorite with the Indians, and for a long
time was the only man, not of their blood, whom they would
suffer to live upon their soil. After his death, as already
mentioned, they placed him in a leaden coffin of their own
manufacture, and buried him on the picturesque bluff which
bears his name; and after this, they destroyed every vestige
of his property.</p>
<p>In process of time, extravagant mineral stories were circulated
throughout the country, and the general government
purchased the Indian El Dorado of its possessors. The first
man who went into the mining business at Galena, after the
country had become our own, was Col. Richard M. Johnson.
Since that time, thousands of people, on various occasions,
have made and lost money in this peculiar business,
which, from its very nature, is in reality a perfect lottery.
Lead, lead, is the burden of every body&rsquo;s song, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the quantities weekly shipped to St. Louis are truly immense.
But a man may dig until doomsday without finding a <i>lead</i>,
and consequently die a beggar&mdash;while another, in a few
months will realize a fortune, upon which he is too apt to
retire, and then squander at the gaming table, so that you also
soon find him an idler, and in want. One individual I have
myself known, who came to Galena with $500, and having
labored with unceasing industry for about three years, and
expended his little fortune, when I saw him, had not the
means of purchasing a loaf of bread, and was utterly without
employment. Notwithstanding the liberal mining regulations
of the government, the fates were against him, and
he was compelled to give up his mineral dreams in despair.
Another individual, whom I saw at Galena, was remarkably
fortunate in his operations. A little more than a year ago
he commenced digging a certain hillside, and the first thing
he knew, his spade struck against a solid mass of ore. He
was encouraged, and proceeded in his excavations, and, in
the course of a single year, sold a sufficient quantity of 80
per cent. ore to amount to the sum of $23,000. His mine
is still yielding quite abundantly, and as it is probably the
best in this region, I will describe it in a few words.</p>
<p>After descending a shaft of some eighty feet in depth,
you find yourself in the centre of an immense cave, with
chambers leading in various directions. The walls and
ceilings are mostly of pure sand, excepting where an occasional
solid mass of native lead glistens like silver or gold,
in the torch-light. Square blocks of the ore, weighing from
half a pound to one hundred, all lie as accurately dovetailed
together, as if placed there by the hands of a master-mason.
While looking upon these singular masses, I could hardly
banish the thought from my mind, that we were in view of
treasures which had been hidden here in those days when
giants inhabited the world. When my curiosity was fully
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
satisfied, I seized the rope, and with a palpitating heart
passed upward out of the bowels of the earth into the pleasant
sunshine.</p>
<p>Major Campton is the name of a noted character, who
once resided at Galena. He is a powerfully built man, who
has spent his whole life among the wildest of mortals, and
whose various occupations have caused him to be well
known from the banks of the Ohio to the shores of Lake
Superior, where he is now figuring in the copper line,
having made and lost a fortune at Galena. A natural consequence
of his peculiar experience is, that he perfectly
understands the art of fighting: though he is so much of a
gentleman, that he could not be called a bully.</p>
<p>It so happened that, while travelling in his own conveyance,
and accompanied by his wife, during a pleasant
day last summer he came to a halt on the margin of a certain
river, and shouted for the ferryman. In due time the
indispensable gentleman was ready, and while inquiring the
news of the day, he was suddenly smitten by a new thought,
and dropping the painter of the old scow, looked inquiringly
into the Major&rsquo;s face, when the following dialogue ensued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger, isn&rsquo;t your name Major Campton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is. What business have you to transact with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the very man I have long been wanting to
see, for you must know that I am the Bully of the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! What do I care for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hearn tell that you are a famous fighter, and I
should like to have you give me a thrashing if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man, I have nothing against you, and do not
want to make a fool of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shall, though, my honey; and you don&rsquo;t cross
this ferry until it is decided who is cock of the walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remonstrance on the part of the Major was all in vain,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
the ferryman was determined to fight. The Major held a
short consultation with his lady, who was of course in great
trouble, but taking off his coat and unbuttoning his straps,
he stept out upon a grassy spot and waited for the ferryman&rsquo;s
attack. To shorten a long story, the fight was a tedious
one, and ended in the total defeat of the challenger, who presented
in himself, after the struggle, an admirable picture of
a misspent life. He had strength enough left, however, to
ferry the Champion over the river; and when the Major
offered to pay the accustomed fare, the latter held not out
his hand, but making a rude bow, he exclaimed;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Not a
dime, sir: good afternoon.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Lake Pepin</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>That portion of the Mississippi which extends from
Prairie Du Chien to Lake Pepin is the most mountainous
and truly beautiful on the whole river, and may with strict
propriety be called the Alpine Region. The river here
varies from a quarter to a full mile in width, and on either
side throughout the whole distance is a range of mountains
which sometimes actually bend over the river, and sometimes
recede into the interior for several miles. The Mississippi
here is rather sluggish, but perfectly translucent, and
completely filled with islands which are covered with every
variety of forest trees found between Kentucky and the
Great Lakes. But the willow and the elm are pre-eminently
beautiful. Well do I remember with what perfect
delight I mused upon the changing landscape, as our vessel
glided onward and onward into the wild and silent wilderness.
The mountains of this region are not quite so lofty
as the Highlands of the Hudson, (to which they have been
compared,) but they are far more picturesque, fantastic, and
extensive. At one moment may be seen a cone-shaped
mountain rising to the height of some eight hundred feet,
and completely covered, to the extreme summit, with a
carpet of grass; now the eye will linger on a perpendicular
bluff, pictured against the sky, like a fortress of the Mound
Builders, and actually frowning upon the softly flowing
stream that laves its foliage-hidden base; now, you sail in
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
the shadow of a pillared temple that seems to prop the sky;
and now, along a continued succession of peaks and points
that fade away, until lost in the rosy atmosphere of evening.
During all this time, your vessel will be gliding around and
between the most charming of green islands, some of them
containing a solitary grave, others a little brotherhood of
Indians, lounging upon the grassy opening before their wigwams;
while some happy bird will favor you with an occasional
song, or the leap of a trout take the fancy captive, to
revel in the cool chambers of the stream. Here it is, too,
that the famous Island Mountain rises to the height of five
hundred feet, completely covered with trees, and capped by
a cluster of broken rocks. It is several miles long and about
one in width, and is the largest island in the Mississippi.
From time immemorial it has been celebrated for the number
of its rattlesnakes, and on a grassy plot at its base stands a
cluster of graves, where repose the ashes of stranger Indians
who died upon the island from wounds inflicted by
these reptiles.</p>
<p>The next object that I would attempt to describe on my
way up the Mississippi, is Lake Pepin. It lives in my
memory as the Horicon of the wilderness. It is an extended
portion of the Mississippi,&mdash;twenty-three miles long, and from
three to four wide. It is surrounded with hills, which abound
in almost every variety of game; its shores are gravelly
and covered with the most valuable of agates and cornelians;
the water is clear, and very deep; and it yields the very
best of fish in great abundance. My first view of Lake
Pepin (I wish I knew how it came by that name!) was on
one of the most charming evenings that I ever witnessed.
The cloudless sky was studded with stars, and the moon sailed
upward and onward with an uncommon beauty, as if proud
of the wilderness world she was then flooding with her beams.
For hours did I sit musing upon the eastern shore, near the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
outlet, whence I could discern no less than sixteen peaks or
bluffs, looming in perfect solitude against the horizon. &ldquo;The
holy time was quiet as a nun, breathless with adoration.&rdquo;
The water was without a ripple, and reflected in its pure
bosom every star, while the moon, as if determined that it
should so remain for ever, spanned it with a bar of gold.
The only sounds that trembled in the air were the hoot of an
owl, the wail of a loon, and a hum from the insect world.
I looked and wondered, until the night was far spent, and the
dew upon my brow was heavy and cold.</p>
<p>It was while tarrying at this lake that the Captain of our
steamer was honored by a visit from Wabashaw, the head
chief of the Sioux nation. He was attended by several of
his counsellors, and in all his movements had the bearing of
a proud prince. He is a young man, and said to be a brave
and eminently successful warrior. Our captain treated him
to wine, and I gave him a present of tobacco. The Captain
was so pleased with the natural curiosity, as he called the
chief, that he summoned all his lady passengers to obtain a
glimpse. The ladies soon made their appearance, and while
staring at the chief, now laughing, and now laying their
hands upon his ornaments, a most ferocious glance all at
once shot from his eye, and uttering a scornful speech, he
bolted from the ring of impudent spectators. The cause of
this singular movement was, that it is considered disgraceful
for a Sioux chief to be seen in the company of women, or to
be spoken to and stared upon by them. The only person
whose hand he would take on going ashore was mine; and
when I happened to meet this chief on a subsequent occasion,
he treated me with marked attention, and presented me with
a handsome pipe.</p>
<p>At the time that I visited Lake Pepin there were quite a
number of Sioux Indians encamped upon its shores. Among
the lodges which I visited was that of a woman, ninety years
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
of age and a widow. She looked exceedingly wretched, but
was so intelligent and amiable that I almost fell in love with
the old antediluvian. I cannot give the whole of her long
story, but an idea of its character may be obtained from the
following episode, which I listened to, seated by her side, and
that of her only descendant&mdash;a handsome boy. Her attention
had been directed to our steamer which lay moored a
short distance off, when she suddenly broke out with the following:&mdash;&ldquo;How
rapidly does time fly! A short time ago
the light canoe was the only thing that glided upon this lake;
but now we often hear the groaning of the great fire-vessel,
as it sweeps along like an angry stag. The white man&rsquo;s
conduct appears strange. I can not understand its purpose.
O, I am an old woman and a fool!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many, very many, have been my trials. Thirty years
has my husband been dead. Eight brave sons have I had,
but they were all killed in battles with the Chippeways. I
also had two daughters, who were like the does of the prairie,
but the Great Spirit has long since taken them to the happy
land. My only relative, now living, is this boy. O, I am
an old woman, and have no business to live!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will not despair. The Great Spirit is at my fireside,
and has given me a helper in the dark evening of my
days. This boy-hunter supplies me with food. His arrow
never fails, and the winds always tell him where to find the
sweet fish. He paddles my canoe, he brings me wood for
my fire, and he sleeps sweetly by my side in my comfortable
lodge. O, I am an old woman!&mdash;but what is there in the
world that I need, and cannot obtain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the smiles of Providence for ever rest upon this
mother of a great nation, whose glory is personified in her
feeble and decrepit form.</p>
<p>The most romantic legend, however, associated with the
Mississippi Horicon is the story of Winona. She was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
daughter of a chief, and lived about one hundred years ago.
She was exceedingly beautiful and universally beloved. Her
father had promised her hand to a favorite warrior, but her
heart had been pledged to another, not less brave, but more
noble and youthful. For many months she would not listen to
the wishes of her father;&mdash;but his sterner nature was roused,
and he vowed that she <i>must</i> marry the object of <i>his</i> choice.
Weeks passed on, and she knew that she must yield. Nightly
did she meet her accepted lover, but always talked to him of
the Spirit Land, as if she had been a queen of that fantastic
realm. The marriage night had been appointed, and the
chief had proclaimed a feast. To all outward appearance a
change suddenly came over the daughter&rsquo;s mind, and she
smiled and talked, like one about to be made a happy bride.
Among the delicacies that were to be eaten on the occasion,
was a certain berry that was found in great perfection upon
a certain hill or bluff. It was a pleasant summer afternoon,
and all the female friends of Winona, accompanied by herself,
were picking the desired berries.</p>
<p>Carelessly did they all wander up the hillside, while an
occasional laugh would ring upon the air; but Winona was
only seen to smile, for (though those loving friends knew it
not) her heart was darkened by many a strange shadow.
Carelessly did the berry-gatherers wander on; when all at
once a low melancholy song fell upon their ears, and lo!
upon the very edge of a beetling precipice stood the form of
the much loved Winona.</p>
<p>Her song was death-like, and when her companions were
intuitively convinced of the contemplated deed, they were
stupified with horror. Winona motioned them to keep back,
while her song increased until it became a perfect wail. The
burthen of it was,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Farewell, sisters:&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I am going to the Spirit Land;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="t0">My warrior will come after me,</p>
<p class="t0">And we shall be blessed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One moment more, and Winona, the pride of all the Indian
villages on Lake Pepin, was deeply buried in its clear
cold bosom. And this is the story that hallows the loftiest
peak of this lake. I obtained it, as here related, from one
of her kindred, and I believe it to be true. As to Winona&rsquo;s
warrior, it is said that he lived for many years a hermit, and
finally died a madman. So runneth many a song of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Mouth of the Saint Peter&rsquo;s</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The scenery between Lake Pepin and the Saint Croix is
not as lofty nor as picturesque as that we have already passed,
but its interest is greatly enhanced by the greater number of
Indians that we here meet. The Red Wing village is nearly
midway between the two lakes mentioned, and contains about
six hundred souls. A short distance from this village are two
isolated mountains, whence may be seen a most magnificent
panorama of the wilderness, and when viewed at sunset presents
more the appearance of dream land than reality.
These mountains from time immemorial have been used as the
altars where Indian war parties have offered up their sacrifices,
previous to going to battle. At the present time, however,
their only inhabitants are rattlesnakes, which slumber
on their sunny slopes or in the clefts of the rocks during the
long summer. And thus is it throughout the world, in the
wilderness as well as the city, death and the beautiful are
ever linked together in an unbroken brotherhood.</p>
<p>I only remained at the Red Wing village one night, but
such a night I hope never to pass again. A perfect outcast
of a trader had furnished the Indians with &ldquo;fire-water,&rdquo;
and the whole posse of them were perfectly mad, for spirituous
liquor always makes the poor Indian miserably crazy.
For want of a better place, I had to sleep in the cabin of
this very trader. My bed was on the floor, while my host
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
and his family occupied a couple of beds in opposite corners
of the only room in the house. And such horrible yelling
and screaming as I heard during the first half of that night,
I can never forget. The noises were perfectly unearthly
and devilish. Now, you might hear the clashing of knives,
as some of the more desperate spirits came together in a
fight; and now you might hear the sobbings and moanings
of a miserable woman, as she exposed and mutilated her
body, to perpetuate the memory of a dead husband or child.</p>
<p>But there was one incident which actually made my hair
stand out like the quills of the porcupine. I should premise
that the few white people of the wilderness never think of
locking their doors at night; and also that the Indians of
this region claim it as a privilege to enter and depart from
your cabin whenever they please, and their intrusions are
always looked upon as matters of course. It was somewhat
after midnight, and the yelling of the savages had partly
subsided. I had just fallen into a doze, when I was startled
by the stealthy opening of our cabin door and the tread of a
muffled footstep. It was intensely dark, but I <i>knew</i> it was an
Indian, and thought that somebody was about to be murdered.
The object in the room made just noise enough to rack my
brain, and then was perfectly still. I listened, and with
hardly a particle of breath in my body,&mdash;I still kept listening,&mdash;until
I actually fainted upon my pillow with excess of fear.
Finally I slept, and my dreams were of blood, and blood
only. The first peep of day, however, awakened me, when
lo! directly at my side, flat on the floor, was a huge black
Indian, breathing in his deep slumber like a porpoise. The
first intelligence that I heard on going out of the door was,
that one Indian had been killed during the night, and that
another was at that moment in the agonies of death. As
may be supposed, I left the Red Wing village with pleasure.</p>
<p>Lake Saint Croix empties into the Mississippi, and its
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
principal inlet is a river of the same name which rises in the
vicinity of Lake Superior. This is the valley through
which the traders and Indians have been in the habit of passing,
for a century past, on their way from the western prairies
to Lake Superior, and from the lake back again to the
prairies. The river is only distinguished for one waterfall
of uncommon beauty. The lake is about twenty-five miles
long, from two to five wide, and surrounded with charming
scenery. The water is clear but of a rich brown color,
and well supplied with fish, of which the trout is the most
abundant.</p>
<p>At the outlet of this lake, I visited another encampment
of Sioux Indians, where I saw a noted chief, named Little
Crow. He was a handsome man, but both of his arms had
recently been broken by a rifle ball, which was shot by one
of his own brothers,&mdash;who was envious of his station as
chief. As a punishment for his wickedness Little Crow
had ordered four bullets to be fired at his brother, which of
course numbered him with the dead. I saw his new-made
grave, and his youthful wife wailing over it, like one that
was sorrowing without hope.</p>
<p>From Saint Croix to Saint Peter&rsquo;s, the banks of the Mississippi
are steep, but only about one hundred and fifty feet
in height. The river is here studded with islands whose
shadowy recesses are cool during the hottest weather;&mdash;and
a more delightful region for the botanist to ramble cannot
be found elsewhere on the face of the earth. The water is
clear as crystal, and its bosom is generally covered with
water-fowl, from the graceful snow-white swan to the mallard
and wood-duck. Isolated Indian wigwams are frequently
seen here, pitched on the margin of the stream, and
at the foot of vine-covered precipices.</p>
<p>But there are three landscape views connected with this
portion of the Mississippi, which I thought perfectly magnificent.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
I witnessed them all during a single afternoon, and
in the light of a mellow sunshine. The first was of a rolling
prairie that faded away to the western sky, until its outline
was actually lost in the hazy atmosphere. Not a solitary
tree did I behold, but a perfect sea of grass, that was
delightfully relieved with flowers of every variety of shape
and color. Occasionally a breeze would pass across the
scene, causing unnumbered tiny billows to quiver over the
surface of mightier ones, which seemed to be careering onward
to some unknown shore. Covering the foreground of
this picture might be seen an immense flock of grouse, feeding,
or chasing each other in sport; and then, an occasional
prairie squirrel as it sat at the entrance of its hole; while
in the middle distance a robber wolf glided over one of the
ridges of the prairie, with his form pictured against the sky.
The lone lost feeling which possessed my heart, when I
thought of the great prairie-world, then lying before me, I
cannot describe; it was composed of delight and melancholy,
of perfect confidence and tormenting fear.</p>
<p>Another picture which I witnessed from a commanding
hill top, was of an untrodden wilderness of woods, reaching
to the extreme horizon on the north. Owing to my elevated
position the forest-world appeared perfectly level, and, excepting
one barren ledge, was without a single object to
mar the monotony of the scene. On that ledge, however,
with the aid of my glass I could just discern the dead body
of a deer, with a black bear reclining at its side, as if sated
with his feast; while in his neighborhood were standing
some thirty vultures in a state of delightful anticipation.</p>
<p>The other scene which I mentioned, was witnessed from
the lofty bluff that fronts the mouth of the Saint Peter&rsquo;s river.
Far beneath my feet glided the majestic Mississippi;&mdash;on
my right stood the handsome and commanding barracks of
Fort Snelling, surmounted by the stars and stripes; on my
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
left, the naked peak of the Pilot&rsquo;s Nob, with a cluster of
trading-houses at its base; directly before me, winding
away like a mighty serpent between a multitude of islands,
lay the deep and turbid Saint Peter&rsquo;s river; and far beyond,&mdash;far
as the eye could reach&mdash;the prairie land, whose
western boundary is the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>The landscape was indeed glorious, and there was something
to gratify my national pride in the flag that fluttered
in the breeze; but when I thought of the <i>business</i> of that
Fort and the <i>end</i> for which the people of the hamlet were
living in the wilderness, the poetry of the scene was marred,
and I longed to dive still deeper in the wild world which reposed
so peacefully before me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Mouth of the Saint Peter&rsquo;s</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The hamlet of Saint Peter is at the mouth of the Saint
Peter&rsquo;s river, and at the head of steamboat navigation on the
Mississippi. My sojourn here has been interesting from
many circumstances. I feel that I am on the extreme verge
of the civilized world, and that all beyond, to the ordinary
traveller, is a mysterious wilderness; and every object which
attracts my attention is made doubly entertaining by the polite
attentions I receive from several gentlemen connected
with Fort Snelling and the Fur Company.</p>
<p>Here it was that I first saw an extensive encampment of
Sioux or Dacotah Indians, who had, within six miles of the
Fort, no less than three large villages. This, as is well
known, is one of the most peculiar and savage tribes of the
northwest, and as I happen to be here during their gala season,
I have had an opportunity of being present at some of
their feasts and games.</p>
<p>On one occasion it was announced throughout the village
that the Indians were to have a Dog Feast, in which none but
the bravest and most distinguished of the warriors are allowed
to participate. The idea that lies at the bottom of this rite is,
that by eating of a dog&rsquo;s liver the heart is made strong. The
feast took place on the open prairie, in the afternoon, and was
attended by about one hundred men, while there must have
been a thousand spectators. The first step in the ceremony
was for the Indians to seat themselves in a circle around a
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
large pole, and devote a few moments to smoking. Their
only article of clothing was the clout, and their only weapon
a long knife, while their heads were decorated with death-trophies,
and their bodies encircled by a belt from which hung
all the scalps the wearers had taken. Suddenly a whoop
was given, and the whole party commenced dancing to the
monotonous music of a drum. Then broke upon the ear
the howl, and in a moment more the dying groan of a dog
from without the circle of dancers. The carcass was thrown
into their midst by a woman. A chorus of deafening yells
resounded through the air, the dog was immediately opened,
his liver taken out, suspended to the pole by a string, and
the dance resumed. A moment had hardly elapsed, however,
before the dancers, one after another, stepped up and
took a bite of the yet warm and quivering liver. Soon as this
was all eaten, another dog was thrown into the ring, and the
same horrible ceremony repeated; and so they continued
until the carcasses of ten dogs were lying at the foot of the
pole in the centre of the dancing crowd. Another human
howl ascended to the sky, and the feast was ended. All
the while the river flowed peacefully onward, and the mellow
sunlight bathed in its own gorgeous hues the illimitable
prairie.</p>
<p>I have also had an opportunity of witnessing in this place
the Indian mode of playing Ball. There is nothing exclusive
in this game, and every male Indian who is sufficiently
active may take a part therein. It sometimes lasts for several
days, and when I witnessed it, was played by two companies
or bands, of about one hundred and fifty individuals
each. The balls used are formed of a deer-skin bag, stuffed
with the hair of that animal and sewed with its sinews. The
clubs are generally three feet long, and have at the lower
end a sinewy netting, sufficiently large to hold the ball, and
each player is furnished with one of these clubs. With these
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
they catch and throw the ball, and though they are not allowed
to touch it with their hands, it is sometimes kept from
once touching the ground for a whole afternoon. The station
of each party is marked by a pole, on a line with which the
players stand, just before beginning the game. The poles are
usually about five hundred yards apart. The ball first
makes its appearance midway between the parties, to which
point a most furious rush is made, and the object to be attained
and which talleys, is, for the player to throw the ball
<i>outside</i> of his own line of standing.</p>
<p>The Olympic beauty of this game is beyond all praise.
It calls into active exercise every muscle of the human
frame, and brings into bold relief the supple and athletic forms
of the best-built people in the world. The only <i>ornaments</i>
worn are of paint and marked all over the body, which, with
the usual exception, is perfectly naked. At one time a figure
will rivet your attention similar to the Apollo Belvidere,
and at another, you will actually be startled by the surpassing
elegance of a Mercury. The only music that accompanies
the game is a chorus of wild clear laughter. The
only drawback connected with it is the danger of getting
your legs broken, or the breath knocked out of your body,
which are calamities that frequently happen.</p>
<p>There are not many particulars with regard to manners
and habits wherein the Sioux Indians differ from their surrounding
brethren. Living, as they mostly do, in a vast
prairie region, their favorite and principal mode of travelling
is on horseback, and away from the larger rivers, you will
find them possessed of the finest horses, which they love and
protect with true Arabian affection. They are of course
admirable horsemen, and very expert in hunting the buffalo.
They are most cruel and vindictive towards their enemies,
and have, from time immemorial, been at war with their
neighbors of the north and west; and their hatred of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
white man seems to be a cherished emotion of their nature.
Physically speaking, they are a noble race of men and
women, but universally considered as the Ishmaelites of the
wilderness. Speaking of these Indians, reminds me of their
pictorial historian, Capt. Seth Eastman. This gentleman is
an officer in the army, and an artist of ability. He is a
native of Maine, has been in the service about eighteen years,
and stationed at Fort Snelling for the last five. All his
leisure time has been devoted to the study of Indian character,
and the portraying upon canvass of their manners and
customs, and the more important fragments of their history.
The Sioux tribes have attracted the most of his attention,
although he has not neglected the Chippeways, and he has
done much to make us acquainted with the Seminoles of
Florida, where he was once stationed for several years.
Excepting a few, which he has occasionally presented to his
friends, all that he ever painted are now in his possession,
and it was my good fortune to spend many agreeable hours
admiring their beauties. The collection now numbers about
four hundred pieces, comprising every variety of scenes,
from the grand Medicine Dance to the singular and affecting
Indian Grave. When the extent and character of this Indian
Gallery are considered, it must be acknowledged the most
valuable in the country, not even excepting that of George
Catlin. But what adds greatly to the interest called forth
by these pictures is the use to which they are to be applied.
Instead of being used as a travelling exhibition to accumulate
gold, this gallery is to be presented to a distinguished college,
from which the artist will only demand the education of his
children. There is something in this movement so foreign
to the sordid passion of our age, and so characteristic of the
true spirit of art, that the heart is thrilled with pleasure as
we remember the American soldier-artist of the wilderness.</p>
<p>I have also had the pleasure of meeting at St. Peter&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
M. Lamarre Piquo, the distinguished French naturalist from
Paris. He has been in the Indian country upwards of a
year, and is to remain some months longer. He is on a professional
tour, collecting specimens in every department of
natural history, and for that purpose is constantly wandering
along the rivers, through the woods, and over the prairies of
the northwest, with no companions but Half-Breeds or Indians.
He seems to be a most passionate lover of his science,
and the appearance of his temporary store-room or museum
is unique and interesting. Here, an immense buffalo stares
at you with its glassy eyes, while just above it, pinned to
the wall, may be seen a collection of curious beetles, butterflies,
and other insects; then an elk and a deer will display
their graceful forms, while at their feet will be coiled up the
rattlesnake, the adder, and other frightful serpents; here
the otter, the beaver, the fox, the wolf, the bear, and other
native animals; there a complete flock of web-footed creatures,
from the wild swan and pelican to the common duck;
here an eagle and hawk, a partridge and scarlet-bird; and
there, embalmed in spirit, a vast variety of curious reptiles.
M. Lamarre Piquo belongs to that honorable class of scholars
whose labors tend to develope the glorious resources of our
country, and among whom we find such men as Wilson,
Audubon, Silliman, and Houghton.</p>
<p>Among the natural beauties associated with St. Peter&rsquo;s
ought not to be forgotten Carver&rsquo;s Cave, the Cascade Waterfall,
the Lakes, and the Pilot&rsquo;s Nob. The Cave is about
four miles below, and was named after Carver, who was the
first white man that explored it thoroughly; its Indian name
however was Wahon-teebe, which means Dwelling of the
Great Spirit. The entrance to it is on the brink of the
river, five feet high and about twice as wide; and the arch
within is not far from fifteen feet high and twenty broad.
The bottom is covered with sand, which slopes down to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
lake of pure water, the opposite boundary of which has
never been visited. On one of the inner sides, not far from
the entrance, are quite a number of Indian hieroglyphics,
partly covered with the moss of by-gone centuries.</p>
<p>About two miles north of St. Peter&rsquo;s there empties into
the Mississippi a small river, without a name, the parent of
a most beautiful waterfall. The stream is perhaps fifty feet
wide, and after a wayward passage across the green prairie,
it finally comes to a precipice of more than one hundred
feet deep, and in an unbroken sheet discharges its translucent
treasure into the pool below. So completely hidden by
a mass of foliage is this fall, that you would pass it by unnoticed,
were it not for its ever-murmuring song. The array
of luxuriant trees that surround it, seem to be acquainted
with its sorrow, for they all bend gracefully over it in sympathy
and love; while the spray which ascends from the
abyss seems like the incense of a mysterious sacrifice. But
before a thought of poetic melancholy can glide into the
heart, the eye is delighted with the form and colors of a
rainbow, and the contradictory and unaccountable influences
of nature make us happy.</p>
<p>The Lakes in the neighborhood of St. Peter&rsquo;s, on the
bosom of the prairie, number some four or five, the most
conspicuous of which are Harriet and Calhoun. They are
not deep, but perfectly clear, abound in fish, and encircled
with sand. The Pilot&rsquo;s Nob is a grass-covered peak, commanding
a most magnificent series of views. To the west
lies a boundless prairie; to the north and south the fantastic
valley of the Mississippi; and to the east a wilderness of
forests and prairie, apparently reaching to the shores of
Michigan. But let us to the Falls of St. Anthony, which
are a few miles above St. Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>These Falls are more famous than remarkable. They
were first visited by Father Hennepin in 1689, who gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
them their present name, out of respect to his patron saint.
Their original name, in the Sioux language, was Owah-Menah,
meaning falling water. They owe their reputation
principally to the fact that they &ldquo;veto&rdquo; the navigation of the
Upper Mississippi. They are surrounded with prairie, and
therefore easily approached from every direction. The
river here is perhaps half a mile wide, and the entire height
of the Falls, including the upper and lower rapids, is said to
measure some twenty-five or thirty feet, and they are consequently
without an imposing feature. The line of the
Falls is nearly straight, but broken near the centre by a
large island, and just below this are no less than seven
smaller but more picturesque islands, which are looked down
upon by steep bluffs on either side of the river. For half a
mile before the waters make their plunge, they glide swiftly
across a slanting, but perfectly flat bed of rock; and after
they have reached the lower level, they create a perfect
sheet of foam, as if venting their wrath upon the rocks
which impede their progress; but in a few moments they
murmur themselves to sleep, and then glide onward towards
the far distant ocean in perfect peace.</p>
<p>These Falls seem to be the grand head-quarters for the
eagles of the wilderness, which congregate here in great
numbers. At one moment a hungry individual might be
seen, struggling with a bass or trout, directly in the pure
foam; and then another, with well-filled crop, high up in
heaven, would be floating on his tireless pinions. At another
time, too, you might see a perfect crowd of them hovering
over the body of some floating animal which had lost its life
while attempting to cross the upper rapids, and fearful indeed
was the shriek of conflict between those warriors of
the air.</p>
<p>Associated with the Falls of St. Anthony is the following
Indian legend. A Chippeway woman, the daughter of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
chief, and the wife of a warrior, had been cruelly treated by
her faithless husband. She was not beautiful, but young
and proud, and the mother of a lovely daughter-child.
Goaded to the quick by repeated wrongs, she finally resolved
to release herself from every trouble, and her child
from evil friends, by departing for the Spirit Land, and the
Falls were to be the gateway to that promised heaven. It
was an Indian summer evening, and nature was hushed into
a deep repose. The mother and her child were alone in
their wigwam, within sight and hearing of the Falls, and the
father was absent on a hunting expedition. The mother
kissed and caressed her darling, and then dressed it with all
the ornaments in her possession, while from her own person
she rejected every article of clothing which she had received
from her husband, and arrayed herself in richer garments
which she had made with her own hands. She then obtained
a full-blown lily, and crushing its petals and breaking
its stem, she placed it on a mat in the centre of her lodge,
as a memorial of her wrongs. All things being ready, she
seized the child, hastened to the river, launched her frail
canoe, and in a moment more was floating on the treacherous
stream. According to a universal Indian custom, she sang
a wild death-song,&mdash;for a moment her canoe trembled on the
brow of the watery precipice, and in an instant more the
mother and child were for ever lost in the foam below.</p>

<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Crow-Wing</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>My mode of travelling, from the Falls of St. Anthony to
Crow-Wing river, was on horseback. I obtained my animal
of a Frenchman, who accompanied me as a guide. There
was no regular road to follow, but only a well beaten trail,
which ran, for the most part, along the eastern bank of the
Mississippi, where lies a continued succession of prairies and
oak-openings. We were each furnished with a blanket, a
small stock of bread and pork, ammunition and a gun. Our
horses were young and fleet, and mine was particularly easy
and graceful in his movements. The day was scorchingly
hot, but I was so anxious to proceed that I ventured out, and
by ten o&rsquo;clock we were on our winding way.</p>
<p>A few hours had elapsed without meeting with a single
adventure, when I fixed my eyes upon my gun, (which then
seemed to be about six times as heavy as when we started,)
and began to wonder whether I was not in a fair way of
illustrating Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s story of the whistle. But before
I had a chance even to cast a look behind, I was startled by
the report of my companion&rsquo;s gun, when lo! just in the
shadow of a neighboring thicket, I saw a large buck make
two frightful leaps and then drop to the earth quite dead.
In a very few moments the two hind quarters of the animal
were enveloped in his hide, and strapped to my friend&rsquo;s
saddle; the tune of my intentions was changed, and after
taking a lunch of bread we continued on our journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Our route, during the afternoon, lay over a portion of
the prairie that was perfectly alive with grouse. My guide
considered them unworthy game for his gun and skill, and
left me to enjoy the sport alone. I had no dog to point
them, but my horse was so well trained to shoot from, that
he answered very well as a substitute. I only had to ride
into the midst of a flock, frighten them, bang away, and dismount
to pick them up. And this was the manner in which
I spent the &ldquo;lucid intervals&rdquo; of our frequent &ldquo;halts,&rdquo; by
way of <i>resting myself</i> and <i>keeping cool</i>. I do not desire to
tell an unreasonable story, but I must say that at sunset I
had, fastened to my saddle, upwards of fifty prairie birds.</p>
<p>We were now on the margin of a handsome stream, in a
natural meadow, and as we found it necessary to feed and
rest our horses, we gave them some water, hoppled them,
and turned them at large. In the mean time we amused
ourselves by cooking and enjoying a portion of our game,
and that was my first supper in the wilderness. We roasted
our meat on one stick, while just above it with another stick
we melted a slice of pork, for the sake of its salty drippings.
We dispatched a comfortable quantity of venison, with an
occasional mouthful of pork and bread, and used the brains,
legs and breast of a grouse, for dessert. Our beverage consisted
of the purest water, which we quaffed in a position
approaching to the horizontal, though our heels were somewhat
nearer heaven than our heads. We concluded our
repast with an hour&rsquo;s snooze, and by the light of a thousand
stars, saddled our horses once more, and resumed our
journey.</p>
<p>It was a cool, calm, cloudless night, and we were the
only human beings on a prairie which appeared to be illimitable.
I was informed, however, that a little speck that
caught my eye far to the westward, was the cabin of an
Indian trader, whose nearest neighbor was one hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
miles off; also that the place was on the Mississippi (which
we had left for a time) and was known as Little Rock. As
I was a good deal fatigued, the poetry of that unique ride did
not make much of an impression upon me. I tried to muster
a little sentiment on the occasion, but just as it was about to
manifest itself in words, my head would suddenly drop upon
my shoulder heavier than a clod; and like a feeble, flickering
lamp, my senses would revive, only to be lulled again into
a doze and nod. But this sleepy state of things was not to
last for ever. It so happened that we discovered directly in
our pathway a solitary wolf, which was snuffing the ground
as if on the scent of some feeble creature that would afford
him a hearty feast. He was an ugly looking rascal, and
called forth from my companion a bitter curse. At his suggestion
we dismounted, and with our guns cocked, approached
the wolf, using our horses as a kind of shield. We had
approached within a reasonable shot of the animal, when it
suddenly started, but seeing nothing but two horses, it paused,
pricked up its ears, and seemed to be whetting its appetite
for a supper of horse-flesh. In a moment, however, the signal
was given, and the two heavy charges of our guns were
lodged in the body of the wolf, which was at that instant
supposed to be in a precarious condition; and having seen
him die, and taken off his hide, we once more mounted our
faithful steeds.</p>
<p>Our excitement having subsided, we gradually fell into
a drowsy state that was &ldquo;heavier, deadlier than before.&rdquo;
But from this were we also roused, and by the tramp or
pattering of feet in our rear. We looked, and behold! a
herd of wolves were coming towards us on the keen run.
Our horses took fright and became unmanageable. The
prairie devils were now almost upon us, when our horses
actually broke loose and away they ran, swifter than the
breeze that suddenly burst upon the plain. It was not long,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
however, before we left our enemies far out of sight, and at
the very moment the day was breaking we reached the
mouth of Crow-Wing river. My companion managed to
retain his venison, but when I came to count my birds, I
found only five remaining, the balance having unintentionally
been left upon the prairie as food for the <i>beastly</i> robbers
of the wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Crow-Wing</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The spot thus designated is beautifully situated on the
east side of the Mississippi, directly at the mouth of the river
known by that name. It is here that the trader Morrison
resides, whose reputation as an upright, intelligent, and
noble-hearted man, is coextensive with the entire wilderness
of the northwest. He is a Scotchman by birth, somewhat
advanced in life, and has resided in the Indian country for
thirty-five years. He possesses all the virtues of the trader
and none of his vices. He is the worthy husband of a worthy
Indian woman, the affectionate father of a number of bright
children, and the patriarch of all the Chippeway Indians,
who reside on the Mississippi. Around his cabin and two
rude store-houses, at the present time are encamped about
three hundred Indians, who are <i>visiting</i> him, and I am
informed that his guests, during the summer, seldom amounted
to less than one hundred. And this is the place where I
have passed ten of the most truly delightful days that I ever
experienced. It is at this point that I am to embark in a canoe,
during my summer tour with Morrison, (accompanied by his
unique suite,) who is to be my guide, counsellor and friend,
while I wander, according to my own free will, over the
lake region of the extreme Upper Mississippi.</p>
<p>Crow-Wing is not only one of the most delightfully located
nooks in the world, but it is rich in historical and legendary
associations. A famous battle was once fought here, between
the Chippeways and Sioux. A party of the latter had gone
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
up Crow-Wing river for the purpose of destroying a certain
Chippeway village. They found it inhabited only by women
and children, every one of whom they murdered in cold
blood, and consumed their wigwams. It so happened that
the Chippeway warriors had been expecting an attack, and
had consequently stationed themselves in deep holes on a
high bank of the river at Crow-Wing, intending to fall upon
the Sioux party on their way <i>up</i> the river. But they were
most sadly disappointed. While watching for their enemies,
they were suddenly startled by a triumphant shout that
floated <i>down</i> the stream. In perfect agony they looked,
when lo! the very party that they were after, came into full
view, shouting with delight and tossing up the scalps which
they had taken. Many a Chippeway brave recognized the
glossy locks of his wife or child, and knew his gloomiest
anticipations to be true. They remained in ambush for a
few minutes longer, and when the enemy came within reach
of their arrows, every single one of them was killed, while
their canoes, plunder and bodies were suffered to float down
the stream unmolested; and the pall of night rested upon
the hills, the glens, the waveless river, and the Chippeway
camp.</p>
<p>Among the many legends associated with Crow-Wing
is one about a white Panther, whose home was here when
the world was young. That Panther was the Prophet of a
certain Chippeway tribe, and had power to speak the Chippeway
language. A young brave was anxious to revenge
the death of a brother, and had sought the oracle to learn
the success of his intended expedition. The Panther told
him that he must <i>not</i> go, but wait until a more propitious
season. But the young man headed his party, and <i>went</i>;&mdash;and
every one of his followers was killed,&mdash;himself escaping
by the merest chance. Thinking that the Panther had caused
this calamity, he stole upon this creature and slaughtered it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
in the darkness of midnight. The dying words of the oracle
were,&mdash;&ldquo;Cruel and unhappy warrior, I doom thee to walk
the earth for ever, a starving and undying skeleton.&rdquo; And
it is said that this spectre man, whenever the moon is tinged
with red, or the aurora borealis floods the sky with purple,
may be seen flitting in perfect solitude along the banks of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>Crow-Wing is the Windsor of the wilderness, for it is the
nominal home of the head Chief of the Chippeway nation.
His name is Hole-in-the-day, and I had frequent opportunities
of visiting him in his lodge. He is about sixty years
of age, and a remarkably handsome man. He is stern and
brave, but mean, vain, treacherous and cruel. He was in
the habit of resorting to the most contemptible tricks, for the
purpose of obtaining whisky, with which he always made a
beast of himself. He was constantly in the habit of talking
about himself, and exhibiting the official papers which he
had received from the Government in making treaties. The
following was the most famous of his deeds, and one that he
had the hardihood to boast of as something creditable. He
and some six warriors, while on a hunting tour, were hospitably
entertained in a Sioux lodge, where resided a family of
seventeen persons. The two nations were at peace, and for
a time their intercourse had been perfectly friendly. On leaving
his host, Hole-in-the-day shook him cordially by the
hand, with a smile upon his countenance, and departed. At
midnight, when the Sioux family were revelling in their
peaceful dreams, Hole-in-the-day and his men retraced their
steps, and without a reasonable provocation fell upon the unprotected
family and cruelly murdered every member, even
to the lisping babe. And it was in the lodge of this titled
leader, that I spent whole hours in conversation, and from
whom I received a present, in the shape of a handsome red-stone
pipe. It is indeed a singular fact, that the most interesting
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
and intelligent nation of the West should be ruled by
such an unworthy chief as Hole-in-the-day.</p>
<p>A word now about his household. He is the husband of
two wives, who pursued, while I was present, their various
avocations in perfect silence. Each of them presented me with
a pair of moccasons, and placed before me whole mocucks
of maple sugar. In passing I might remark, that when the
Indians are hard pushed for flour or game, they will resort
to their sugar, upon which they can live for days, and which
they consider the most wholesome of food. The children
that swarmed about the chief&rsquo;s lodge, I was unable to number.
His eldest son and successor I frequently met, and
found him to be a perfect Brummel of the woods. The following
story gave me a glimpse of his character. Some
months ago, the idea had entered his head that his father was
jealous of his increasing popularity among the <i>people</i>. He
was seriously affected by it, and in a fit of anger resolved to
starve himself to death. His friends laughed at him, but to
no purpose. He left his home, marched into the woods and
ascended a certain hill, (called Look-Out hill, and used from
time immemorial, by the Indians, as a point from which to
watch the movements of their enemies ascending or descending
the Mississippi,) where he remained four days without a
particle of food. He was only rescued from death by the
timely discovery of his friends, who took him away by force,
and actually crammed some nourishment down his throat.</p>
<p>But my Crow-Wing stories are not all related yet. I
here saw, <i>alive</i> and <i>quite happy</i>, a warrior who was once
<i>scalped</i> in a skirmish on the northern shore of Red Lake.
His enemies left him on the ground as dead, but wonderful to
relate, he gradually recovered, and is now as well as any
body, but perfectly hairless, of course, and wears upon his
head a black silk handkerchief. The summer after this
event he was hunting buffalo in the Sioux country, when he
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
had another fight with two Indians, both of whom he succeeded
in butchering, and one of those very men was the
identical Sioux who had taken his scalp a few months before.</p>
<p>During my sojourn here, I have had frequent opportunities
of witnessing the Indian mode of swimming. To
speak within bounds, there must be some sixty boys at
Crow-Wing, who enjoy a swim about every hour. When
not in the water, they are hard <i>at work</i> playing ball, and
all in the sweltering sunshine, with their ragged looking
heads entirely uncovered, and their bodies almost naked.
Just as soon as the child is loosened from its prison cradle, it
is looked upon as a fit candidate for any number of duckings,
which are about its only inheritance. These children are
just as much at home in the water as a full-fledged duck.
They swim with great rapidity, always extending one arm
forward, like a bowsprit, and holding the other closely at the
side. They are so expert in diving that when a number are
pursuing a particular individual, and that one happens to dive,
the whole of them will follow after, and finally all come up
a hundred yards off. To bring up a pebble from a hole
twenty feet deep is looked upon as a very common feat.
This art seems to be inherent in their nature, and is the gift
of a wise Providence;&mdash;for all their journeys are performed
on the water, and their canoes are as frail as frailty itself.
It is very seldom that we hear of an Indian being drowned.</p>
<p>The only Indian ceremony I have witnessed at this place,
is called the Begging Dance. A large party of <i>brave</i> warriors
had come to pay their white father (Mr. Morrison) a
<i>disinterested</i> visit, but as they were nearly starved, they said
not a word, but immediately prepared themselves for the
dance, that is universally practised throughout the nation.
It was night, and all the people of Crow-Wing were stationed
in a large circle before Morrison&rsquo;s door; while one swarthy
form held aloft a birchen torch, which completed such a picture
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
as was never equalled upon canvass. The everlasting
drum, and rattling of &ldquo;dry bones,&rdquo; commenced their monotonous
music; when the most ridiculously dressed man that I
ever beheld, stepped out from the crowd and commenced
dancing, keeping time with a guttural hum. Upon his head
was a peaked woollen hat, and his flowing hair was filled and
entangled with burs. On his back he wore the remnant of
an ancient military coat, and on one leg the half of a pair of
breeches, while his other propelling member was besmeared
with mud. In one hand he held the empty skin of a skunk,
and in the other the gaunt body of a dead crane. Immediately
after this rare specimen, appeared in regular succession
about twenty more dressed in the same manner, and when all
out, their dancing capers were even more uncouth and laughable
than their personal appearance. The object of all this was
to exhibit their abject poverty, and create an atmosphere of
good nature; and it was their method of asking Mr. Morrison
for food. Soon as he had supplied them with flour and
pork, they ceased dancing, seized the booty, and departed for
their wigwams to enjoy a feast. On the following day, this
band of gentlemen made their appearance, painted, and
decked out in most splendid style, with the feathers, ribbons,
scarlet leggins, and other ornaments which they had
kept hidden until after the dance and feast were ended.</p>
<p>I have as yet accomplished but little in the way of hunting;
that is, but little for this region. On one occasion I
killed seven fine <i>looking</i> ducks, which turned out, however,
to be unfit to eat, as they were of the dipper species, and a
little too fishy even for my taste; at one time I killed twenty-five
pigeons; at another about a dozen grouse; and last of all
a couple of young coons. This latter game, I would remark,
afforded me one of the most delectable of feasts.</p>
<p>But in the way of fishing, the waters about Crow-Wing
have treated me to some of the rarest of sport. The Mississippi
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
at this point contains a great variety of fish of the
mullet and sucker genus, but the only two desirable kinds
are the muskanounge and a very large pike. I tried some
of these with a fine hook hidden in the breast of a frog, (the
disciples of Byron will please not take the hint, and accuse
me of inhuman cruelty,) but I could not tempt them in that
way. The <i>fashionable</i> mode for taking them is with a
spear, by torchlight, and during half the hours of one night
I performed the part of a devotee to fashion. My pilot was
an Indian, and we went in a birchen canoe, using birch-bark
for a torch. There were quite a number of canoes out that
night, and the gliding about of the various torches, the wild
shores, the ever-varying bed of the river, and my own occasional
struggle with an immense fish,&mdash;conspired to throw
me into a nervous state of excitement which has not entirely
left me at the present moment. I did think of mentioning
the number of prizes that were taken on that memorable
night, but my modesty forbids; I will only say that I saw
extended on the shore a muskanounge that weighed fifty-seven
pounds, and a pike that almost weighed twenty-four.</p>
<p>Two miles east of Morrison&rsquo;s house is a little lake, some
four miles in circumference, which is said to contain no other
fish than black bass. My own experience tells me that this
report is true. I angled along its sandy shores a number of
times, and could take nothing but bass. They were small,
weighing about a pound, of a dark green color on the back,
sides a brilliant yellow, and belly perfectly white. I took
them with a fly, and to the palate found them perfectly
delicious.</p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Crow-Wing</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The Indian trader belongs to the aristocracy of the
wilderness. His business is to barter with the Indians for
their furs, as the agent of some established fur company.
He is generally a Frenchman, whose ancestors were traders
before him, and of course a native of the wild region he inhabits.
Such are the facts with regard to the individual I
am about to portray, and I purpose, by this specimen, to
give my reader a faithful idea of the class to which he
belongs.</p>
<p>The residence of my friend is on the Saint Peter&rsquo;s, near
the brow of a picturesque point formed by a bend of the
river, and his nearest white neighbor is <i>only</i> two hundred
miles off. The dwelling that he lives in is built of logs,
and contains one large room and a garret. Adjoining this
cabin is another of the same character, where he keeps his
merchandise; which consists chiefly of pork, flour, blankets,
blue and scarlet cloths, and various kinds of trinkets. His
household is composed of an Indian wife and a full assortment
of half-breed children, who are generally possessed of
a good deal of natural shrewdness, but of course utterly
ignorant of books and the ways of the civilized world. Adjoining
the trader&rsquo;s residence is about one acre of ploughed
ground, where he cultivates a few common vegetables; and
he keeps a solitary cow, which yields him the only luxury
that he enjoys. His live stock is very extensive, but not of
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
that character which is profitable,&mdash;it is peculiar to the
wilderness, and in our section of country would be called a
menagerie. The following is a correct list of my friend&rsquo;s
treasures in this particular, viz.:&mdash;one grisly bear, two
black bears, two fawns, one fox, one coon, one eagle, one
crow, one cormorant, a flock of wild geese, two swans,
and one owl. In addition to these I ought to mention a
herd of Indian dogs, and a brotherhood of Indians, who are
nearly always encamped in the vicinity of the trader&rsquo;s
dwelling.</p>
<p>Now, as to the manner of the trader&rsquo;s life. Though I
did not intend to make a hero of my friend, I must say that
the life he leads is heroic to an uncommon degree. His
resting time is during the summer months, when his principal
business is to obtain his merchandise and attend the
various Indian payments that may happen to be made. But
during the winter, which is long and very severe in this
region, he visits, with one or two companions, the hunting-grounds
of the Indians,&mdash;leaving his home heavily loaded
with goods and provisions, and returning, still more heavily
laden with packs of furs and peltries. The hardships and
privations that he then endures, would, in a single month,
utterly destroy a common constitution; but they are treated
by him as matters of very little consequence, for his constitution
seems to be of an iron nature. Several days does he
sometimes spend without a particle of food;&mdash;now, snowbound
in the pathless woods, and now surrounded, perhaps,
by a band of hostile Indians, who may succeed in robbing
him of his furs. Now it is his fortune to struggle for life
with some half-famished beast; and now he has to endure
the frightful dangers of fording angry and partly frozen
rivers. Cold, fatigue, and hunger are at the foundation of
almost every scene that he passes through during the cheerless
winter months of every year, in the Indian Territory of
the northwest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The intellectual and moral character of our Indian
trader is what would be expected from a man in his condition.
He knows not how to read or write, and is consequently
dependent upon a clerk for the prosecution of his
epistolary business and the keeping of his memorandum
books. In politics he is nothing, as he has not, from his
location, the privilege of voting; but his sympathies are invariably
with those officers of the Government who project
and carry out measures nominally for the benefit of the poor
Indians, but more particularly for his own. In religion, he
is a blind adherent to the Pope of Rome. The glittering
dollar seems to be the star of his ambition. Having been
for many years an agent for the famous but most outrageous
American Fur Company, he has become hardened, and,
like his <i>teacher</i> in the science of oppressive monopoly,
seldom hesitates at any course of conduct that will prove
lucrative. He avows himself the best and only friend of
the Indian, and yet his every act of kindness is accompanied
by a moral stab. He buys a pack of furs and allows the
hunter the current price, but then he pays him in flour at
<i>fifty</i> dollars per barrel, and blankets at ten dollars apiece;&mdash;but
far worse, he sells to the benighted savage the baneful
fire water, which makes him a perfect devil.</p>
<p>But the trader has some redeeming qualities, and I know
not that I am disposed to write him down as more ignorant
or wicked than his <i>civilized</i> fellow-men in the same sphere of
life. At the same time that he imposes upon the poor Indian,
in more ways than one, it is also true that he is his friend
when cold and hungry. The Indian is such a thoughtless
and improvident creature, that it is absolutely necessary he
should have some one to watch over him and keep him from
starving. And often is the trader&rsquo;s duty, in this particular,
faithfully performed; with all his faults he would sooner die
than see an Indian suffer. Take the trader away from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
cares of business, as you sometimes may employ him as your
guide in a hunting expedition, and you will find him a most
interesting companion. Strange as it will seem, he is a devoted
lover of nature, and being superstitious, he has a legend
in his head for every picturesque nook of the woods and
prairies, and for every beast or bird which may happen to
cross your path. He is well acquainted with the geography
of the northwest, and makes an occasional rude map upon
birch bark, which are of great value to those who execute
them on a large scale for our Government. That portion of
Nicolet&rsquo;s map, representing the extreme head of the Mississippi,
was made upon bark, by Francis Brunet, who is to be my
guide for hundreds of miles. He is also well acquainted with
the traditionary history of the Indian tribes, and knows well
the character of every chief and remarkable personage now
living. He has a kindly nature, and his whole conduct is
agreeably softened by an innate politeness. He is, to sum
up all, a most romantic, but very useful and influential
character, and in intellect the aristocrat of the wilderness.</p>
<p>I may append with propriety to this sketch, a few words
about the fur trade generally, as it now exists beyond the
Mississippi. A division took place in the American Fur
Company a few years ago, and while one party was headed
by Piere Choteau, and traded on the Missouri, the other remained
under the guiding hand of Ramsey Crook, and confined
its operations to the region of the Great Lakes. The
principal men in this fur trade, before and since the family
division, succeeded in accumulating large fortunes, but both
of the companies, which retain the original name, are supposed
to be, at any rate, no better off than they should be.
For my part I am not surprised at this result, when I know
the overbearing and monopolizing character of these companies,
and when I believe in the theory that iniquity has its
reward even in this world. Many of the deeds that have
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
been, and are still, sanctioned by the so-called American Fur
Company, are of such a character as to be worthy of the severest
condemnation; out of its many iniquities I will mention
only one. This company has located its agents in every
eligible corner of the wilderness, for the ultimate purpose of
accumulating gold; and when the poor missionary of the
cross has crept along through untold hardships to plant the
banner of a pure religion, for the benefit of the red man, he
has been insulted and driven away. But I like not this theme,
and will let it pass into forgetfulness. When I am told that
the beaver and the otter and other valuable animals are rapidly
becoming extinct, and that the glory of the American
Fur Company is for ever departed, I cannot but believe that
there is a wise and just Providence, who holdeth the world
in the hollow of his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Spirit Lake</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>This Lake, which the French have named Mill Lac, and
certain ignorant Yankees, Rum Lake, was originally called
by the Chippeways, Minsisagaigoming, which signifies the
dwelling place of the Mysterious Spirit. In form it is almost
round, and about twenty miles across in the widest part.
The shores are rather low, but covered with a luxuriant
growth of oak, hard maple, and tamarack. It is shallow,
but clear and cold; has a sandy bottom, and yields a variety
of fish; and contains only three islands, which are small
and rocky.</p>
<p>The Mysterious Spirit alluded to above has acquired a
great notoriety on account of his frequently taking away into
the spirit land certain people whom he loved. Sometimes he
would take them for a few days, and sometimes he would
not return with them at all. The following stories were
given to me as facts, and I know were actually believed.
An Indian, with his family, had encamped upon the lake for
one night, and just as he was about to depart on the following
morning, he could not find his only child, a little girl. At
one moment she was seen picking up some pebbles near her
father&rsquo;s canoe, and the very next was gone. For six days
did they seek the child, but in vain. On the seventh day,
however, as they were about to depart once more, (having
given up all hope of recovering the lost one), they looked,
and behold! she was again picking up pebbles beside the
canoe, as unconcerned as if nothing had happened. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
questioned, she answered that she had only been taken away
by a beautiful lady to a beautiful land, where she had been
happy in seeing many beautiful things.</p>
<p>Once when there was a party of Indians encamped here,
a favorite young girl was discovered to be missing, and her
friends, supposing that she had been drowned, were mourning
bitterly at her departure; one day she made her appearance
in her father&rsquo;s lodge, as if nothing had happened, and
was accompanied by two dogs. Her story was, that an old
woman had taken her to an island, presented her with the
animals, and bade her prepare for a long journey. She was
absent for three weeks, but on the day of her return was
numbered with the dead.</p>
<p>A little boy was also once lost on the margin of this lake.
The only trace of him that ever could be discovered, was one
of his arrows found lodged in a tree. And the Indians believe
too that the aged mother of Hole-in-the-day (the great
chief) was also carried away by this Mysterious Spirit. One
thing is certain, say they, she disappeared in the twinkling
of an eye from the party with whom she was travelling many
years ago. These are indeed idle legends, but give us an
insight into the Indian mind.</p>
<p>The following is an historical fact, which only proves the
obstinacy of their principal actor. Many years ago, a chief
named White Fisher, with his family and a party of braves,
were encamped in one large lodge on the north side of Spirit
Lake. A friendly Indian entered the cabin at sunset, and
told the chief that he had seen a war-party of three Sioux on
his trail. The chief scorned to believe the story, because
his dreams had told him nothing about an enemy. In a short
time his eldest son returned from his evening hunt, and said
that he had also seen three Sioux in the woods about a mile
off;&mdash;but the father continued to disbelieve. Finally the
chief&rsquo;s own brother told him a similar story, which was also
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
treated with contempt. It was now morning, and the chief
made his appearance outside of his lodge, and was about to
go upon a hunt;&mdash;but in the twinkling of an eye three balls
passed through his body, and he died. Every single member
of his household was killed, excepting his youngest son,
who was taken prisoner, lived in the Sioux country for
twenty years, but finally returned to his own people, and he
was the identical individual from whose lips I obtained the
above facts. He is now a chief, and universally known by
his father&rsquo;s name, Wabogike, or White Fisher.</p>
<p>On the west bank of Spirit River, where it leaves the
lake, is the rude grave of Kitcheoseyin, or Elder Brother,
who was one of the most famous orators of his nation. He
was a noted chief, and on one occasion had given up into the
hands of the white men a certain Chippeway murderer. His
people were very angry at him, and it was currently reported
that he was about to be assassinated. He heard of this interesting
movement, and immediately summoned a council.
The warriors were all assembled, and when the pipe had
been passed entirely round, the chief stepped forward and
addressed the council in the following words, which were repeated
to me by one who heard them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, relatives, and brothers. My object in calling
you together in council is this. I hear that you desire to
take away my life because I have given up to the white men
a Chippeway Indian, who had murdered one of their people.
I have done so, brave men, and I think I have done right.
That man who committed the murder was a <i>bad dog</i>,&mdash;he was
not a true Chippeway Indian, and for his wicked deed he deserves
to die. Had we been at war with the white nation, it
would have been well,&mdash;but we are at peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, brothers, I understand that you accuse me of siding
with the pale faces, and that you think such conduct wrong.
I do love the white men, and I do not think my conduct
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
wrong. Who is it, I would ask you, that supplies us with food
when game is scarce, and who gives the warm blanket to
protect us from the winter cold? Who is it that gives us the
guns that we so much need, and the tobacco that we so much
love? You know that it is the white man, and you know
too that you act like fools to blame me for my conduct, and
seek to kill me because I would be an honest Chippeway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, warriors, that I do love the white man, and I
am ready to die for his sake. You cannot compel me to
change my opinion. Make a hole in the lake yonder, take
me by force and place me under it until I am almost dead,
then pull me up and ask me, &lsquo;Will you side with the white
man now?&rsquo; and I will answer, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Do it again, and
again, and again, and I will always answer, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and also
that &lsquo;the white man is the best friend we have.&rsquo; Friends,
I command you to go home, and ever hereafter mind your
own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem this speech had the desired effect,
and entirely quelled the rising storm. The chief was not
killed, but died many years afterward with the lockjaw, from
a cut that he accidentally received on his foot.</p>
<p>The ruling chief of Spirit Lake, at the present time, is
Naguanabic, or Outside Feather. He is said to be the most
worthy, intelligent and influential of all the Chippeway chiefs.
I spent many agreeable and instructive hours in his lodge,
and among my Indian curiosities there is nothing that I value
more highly than the presents I received from him. It does
my heart good to remember the old man, and the beautiful
lake which is his home.</p>
<p>A son of this old Indian, while hunting, once pursued a
deer to a very great distance, which he finally captured.
Out of revenge for the <i>improper</i> conduct of the animal, the
cruel Indian tortured it in a variety of ways, and came home
boasting of what he had done. At the feast usually given on
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
such occasions, this old chief addressed his son in the following
words: &ldquo;We are thankful to the Great Spirit for furnishing
us with food. But my son has acted very wrong in torturing
that animal, and if the laws of the Great Spirit are
not changed from what they were in times past, that boy shall
not be privileged to kill another deer during the whole winter.&rdquo;
And I was told that he did not, and that no cruel
hearted man ever can, under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>It was from the lips of this aged Indian that I obtained the
following legend.</p>
<p>A thousand winters ago, the Great Spirit caused the sun
to be fastened in the heavens, for the purpose of destroying
the world on account of an enormous sin which had been
committed. The men of that time assembled together in
council, but could devise no means to avert the calamity.
The animals of the earth also held a council, and they were
about to give up all hopes of a release, when a small animal
stept forth and avowed its intention of gnawing off the string
that held the sun. He entered the earth, and after travelling
a long time, finally reached the desired planet and accomplished
his purpose. The heat of the sun, however, was so
great, that the sight of the heroic little animal was impaired,
and it returned to the earth&mdash;a poor blind mole.</p>

<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">In my Canoe</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Winnipeg is the first lake of importance which the traveller
<i>passes through</i> on his way up the Mississippi from Crow-Wing,
and it is a namesake of the great northern lake. The
banks of the river throughout this long distance do not
average more than about ten feet in height, and are all the
way covered with a stunted growth of trees, where the birch,
the elm, the pine, and the spruce mostly predominate. It is
so exceedingly winding here, that by making a portage of
fifteen rods, you may often save some three or four miles of
canoe travel. The stream varies from an eighth to half a
mile in width; sometimes shallow and rapidly running over
a rocky bed, sometimes widening into a shallow lake, and
sometimes deep, and running sluggishly through a soil of
clay or sand, and almost blocked up with snags.</p>
<p>The meaning of Winibigoshish, or Winnipeg, is, the
grand reservoir, or dep&ocirc;t of water. The lake is fifteen
miles in length and perhaps ten in width. It is nearly
round, has no islands, but a gravelly and sandy bottom, and
is surrounded by a handsome beach; the water is clear and
shallow, and it contains no fish but those that I have elsewhere
mentioned as peculiar to this section of the Mississippi.
The surrounding country is a dead level, composed
of continuous woods, which are every where interspersed
with lakes and rice swamps, where unnumbered waterfowl
have lived and multiplied for centuries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The only inhabitants that we found on the shores of
Winnipeg, were three bands of Chippeways, numbering in
all about one thousand souls. We pitched our tent in the
midst of their encampment, or village, and managed, so far
as I was concerned, to spend a day and night among them
quite pleasantly. Immediately on my arrival there, I heard
something about a contemplated bear hunt. It happened to
be the month when this animal performs its annual journey
to the south, whence it returns in October. A number of
them had already been killed, and there was a crossing
place on the Mississippi, where a good marksman might take
one almost at any time. I found that there were but two
men going on the hunt, and, as a present of tobacco soon
initiated me into their good graces, the party of course was
increased to three. We started at sunset and descended to
the crossing place in a canoe, where we ambushed ourselves
in one of the wildest recesses in the forest, seated on a mossy
rock that commanded an opening between the trees, while
our canoe was hidden by a willow that bent gracefully over
the stream. It was a clear, still night, but quite dark, as
there was no moon. Here we spent a number of hours,
without uttering a word; but listening meanwhile to the
dismal shriek of an owl, or the silvery dropping of the dew
on the gently flowing river. Finally, however, one of the
Indians tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed to a large
black object, which I saw was a bear just wading into the
water, directly on the opposite side from where we were
seated. I had been told not to fire until the signal was
given, and so the following five minutes seemed longer than
an ordinary hour, to my impatient mind. The bear took it
quite leisurely, not dreaming that an enemy was so near.
But just as his feet touched the bottom on our side of the
stream, the Indians gave me a nod, and raising our several
guns, we all three fired at the poor animal, who dropped into
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
the water quite dead, creating around him a crimson pool.
We shipped the animal on board the canoe, paddled to the
village, and hanging it on the high limb of a tree, retired to
our several wigwams and slept until morning.</p>
<p>On making my appearance among the Indians after
breakfast, I found that I was to witness the ceremony which
invariably follows the capture of a bear. I ought to remark
in this place, that the animal in question was supposed by
Morrison to weigh three hundred pounds. The Indian who
had first <i>touched</i> the bear with his hand, (according to a
universal custom among the Chippeways,) was the one who
claimed it as his own. When he had taken off the skin, he
presented it to a brother hunter, who from that moment considered
himself under obligations to return the compliment
at the earliest moment after his next successful hunt. The
animal was then dressed, and the four quarters hung up in
our hunter&rsquo;s wigwam, that being the only portion allotted to
him by custom; while the head, back-bone, and ribs, the
feet, the heart, liver, and fat, were all served up for a feast.
A red feather was then sent to all the principal men in the
village as an invitation, which they understood to be to a
bear feast, while the <i>common</i> class of men were verbally
invited, women and children being denied the privilege of
participating. At the appointed hour the guests made their
appearance, in a neighboring grove, each one carrying in
his hand a wooden bowl or dish. After they were comfortably
seated in a large circle, a bag of ka-nick-a-nick
and tobacco was circulated, and a cloud of fragrant smoke
ascended to the sky,&mdash;for the Indians invariably commence
their ceremonies by smoking. The next step was to place
upon a fire in their midst a large kettle containing the remnants
of the bear, which were to be boiled to a kind of
soup, without the least particle of seasoning. While
this was cooking, one of the orators of the day delivered a
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
speech, wherein he thanked the Great Spirit for telling his
red children where to find the bear, and concluding with
some remarks upon the characteristics of the animal. When
the bear chowder was done, it was equally distributed
among the assembled crowd, and each one required to eat
the whole that was placed before him, and this too without
a ladle or lifting his dish, but on his hands and knees in the
common attitude of a bear. The bones were then all replaced
in the kettle and deposited in some safe place; to
neglect this part of the ceremony would be to anger the
Great Spirit, who would not allow the giver of the feast to
kill another bear.</p>
<p>Among the stories which I heard at Lake Winnipeg, was
the following,&mdash;given to me by an aged chief as a fact, but
which I cannot consider in another light than as a legend. It
illustrates, however, the influence of dreams upon the savage
mind. An Indian named Otneagance (Little Shoulder),
while hunting after deer, on a cold winter day, came to the
margin of this lake, where he built a fire and spent the night.
He had a dream, and thought that he was crawling under
ground, for the purpose of rescuing a human being from
death. On opening his eyes in the morning, he was greatly
surprised to see a woman on the ice a short distance off.
She was standing near an air-hole, and wailing on account
of her child, a little boy, who had fallen through and must
inevitably perish. Soon as the hunter heard the woman&rsquo;s
story, he dove into the hole, saw the child a great distance
off, holding out its hands, swam to it, and in a few minutes
placed it in its mother&rsquo;s arms&mdash;alive. &ldquo;And yonder,&rdquo; said
the chief, pointing to a little mound, &ldquo;is the resting place of
that good mother, and before you stands that boy&mdash;changed
to a trembling reed. As to my saviour, Otneagance, he has,
for many moons, been a resident in the Hunting Grounds of
the Blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Speaking of the dead reminds me of the Winnipeg grave-yard.
The Chippeway mode of treating their dead, is to envelop
the body of their friend in a bark box, which they expose
upon a scaffolding, supported by four poles, and surmounted
with a piece of skin or cloth as a flag. After the body
has remained there until all decomposition is at an end, they
then bury the bones, placing at the head of the grave a portion
of the best food at that time in their possession. They afterwards
cover the hillock with bark, somewhat after the manner
of a roof, leaving at one end a little window or door, for the
departed spirit to enter, when it comes to take away its bones,
on a certain mysterious day, to which the living all look forward
with reverence. When a friend dies, for one whole
year thereafter they place food and tobacco periodically upon
his grave; and all the articles that he left behind are venerated
and cherished, as if endowed with life. Their manner
of mourning for the dead ordinarily is, to paint their faces
black, but when their friend is taken away by violence, they
wail and mutilate their bodies. It is a part of their religion
to protect from sacrilege and exposure the remains of their
departed friends, and the survivors are constantly repairing
every ruin that accident or time may bring upon the graves
of their kindred. The grave-city that attracted my attention
at Winnipeg, consisted of seventy-six bark houses like those
that I have described. In fifty-two of them reposed the ashes
of fourteen families who were butchered, at midnight, by a
Sioux war party. In five of them were buried a mother and
four daughters, who lost their lives while fishing on the lake,
in frail canoes, that were swamped by a sudden storm. In
seventeen of them lay the remains of as many warriors who
were attacked by a Sioux party of two hundred,&mdash;they fought
in a single trench, for one whole day, but were finally overcome
and destroyed.</p>
<p>The melancholy impression which these brief facts left
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
upon my mind, as I stood in that wilderness grave-yard, I
could not easily dissipate. What a strange contrast in every
particular did it present to the grave-yards of the civilized
world! Not one of all this multitude had died in peace, or
with a knowledge of the true God. Here were no sculptured
monuments, no names, no epitaphs;&mdash;nothing but solitude
and utter desolation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">In my Canoe</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Red Cedar Lake is the sheet of water Mr. Schoolcraft has
attempted to name after a distinguished friend; I say <i>attempted</i>,
because the Indians and traders of the northwest do not recognize
his change. I agree with them in the opinion that it <i>is not
right</i> for travellers to glorify themselves or friends by attempting
to supplant with their own, the original and appropriate
names that belong to the rivers and lakes of our land. If the
ambitious can discover <i>nameless</i> wonders, they will then be
privileged to use <i>them</i> in extending their reputations.</p>
<p>Red Cedar Lake takes its Indian name from the tree that
mostly abounds upon its shores. It appears to contain but
little more water than Winnipeg, but it has near its centre a
large island, which causes it to appear much larger on the
map. It has a great many bays and several islands; has a
sandy bottom and fine beach; is shallow, clear, and yields a
small white fish, a few trout, and the plebeian varieties hereafter
mentioned as native to the Mississippi. The shores
of this lake are gently undulating, and must have been
originally quite beautiful; but when I was there it was almost
without inhabitants, and the places where once stood
large clusters of wigwams, were covered with bare poles
and ashes, and presented a most desolate appearance. The
only family that I saw, was composed of a widow and her
children, whose father had died two winters ago, while crossing
the lake on his return from a hunting expedition. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
perished from cold and hunger, while in full view of the
cabin which sheltered his wife and children. And here,
more than a thousand miles from a really comfortable dwelling,
lived this unfortunate widow&mdash;ignorant, destitute, and
without friends. The story which she told me, and the
wretched picture that her condition presented, kept me from
inquiring into the legendary lore of this lake, so that I spent
my only evening there, listening to the desultory conversation
of my friend Morrison. The <i>facts</i> which I then gathered
are now subjoined.</p>
<p>The entire region watered by the unnumbered lakes of
the Upper Mississippi, including Superior and Michigan, is
now inhabited by the Chippeway nation. The most of it
they have acquired by right of conquest, and principally
from the Sioux nation, which is the principal cause that has
so often deluged this territory with blood. Their idea of the
creation is as follows. Originally, when the globe (as they
suppose) was an entire mass of water, the only living creature
that existed was an immense bird, from whose eyes
glanced the lightning, and whose voice was thunder. It so
happened that this creature was oppressed with solitude, and
having touched the water with its wings, the continents immediately
appeared; and from the beams of the stars were
born the first race of men, and from the winds all the animals
of the earth. The Chippeways universally acknowledge the
existence of a Supreme Being, whom they call Kitchi-Manitou,
which signifies Great Spirit, and they reverence this Being
as one from whom nothing but good can proceed. They
also believe in an Evil Spirit, called Matcho-Manitou, who
is a hater of all men, and the source of every misery. They
also believe in a great number of spirits of more limited
power than the above; and they have one of these for the
sun and moon, for every lake, river, and mountain, of any
note; and for every season of the year, as well as for every
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
beast, bird, fish, reptile, and insect, that may have acquired
a reputation among them. To all of these are they in the
habit of making offerings, which are as various as the spirits
themselves. Death, with them, is always looked upon as a
matter of course, and a blessing. When a good man dies
they suppose that he is taken across a certain river into a
land of perpetual sunshine, of beautiful woods, streams, and
prairies, where every variety of game is always at hand, and
fruit upon every tree; where they will have nothing to do but
love each other, and live in the enjoyment of perfect peace.
When a bad man dies, he is compelled to attempt to cross
another river on a bridge of reeds, through which he inevitably
falls into the angry waters, which are sure to transport
him to a distant country, which is barren, always covered
with snow, and very cold. He is to live there in a state of
perpetual hunger, eternally shivering under the influence
of biting winds.</p>
<p>Their manner of winning the title of a Brave, when
there is no chance of distinguishing themselves in war, as at
the present time, is to retire into a lonely nook in the woods,
where they remain for six days without a particle of food.
While there, they commemorate each day by making a notch
on a stick, and when they finally make their appearance in the
village, with a stick of six notches, they are welcomed as
accomplished warriors. They are trained, almost from the
hour of their birth, to endure every possible hardship, which
ever makes them superior to a sense of suffering or fear of
death. And the two great objects which prompt them to all
this, are, that they may be able always to protect their relatives
and friends from harm, and to shield their country from
every aggression. It is a part of their religion to revenge
every wrong, and when their terrible passions are roused,
nothing but blood can stop them in their march of cruelty.
This trait is inherent in their nature, even as the taste of
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
blood will whet the appetite of the leopard and lion,&mdash;and I
know not that the Divine Will, in its wisdom, would have this
state of things altered. If otherwise, it were reasonable
to expect that the hand of God would fall heavily upon the
white man, for placing the yoke of a most bitter oppression
upon the unhappy Indian tribes. Many of the vices which
were once almost hidden in their simple natures, have been
ripened into full maturity by the example and allurements
of their civilized brethren. They deeded to us their beautiful
domains, and we have recompensed them with a cup of
poison, and the deadly principles of infidelity. And yet we
(as a people) think it just and charitable to speak of the
poor Indian with a curse upon our lips.</p>
<p>The following is an outline of the Indian&rsquo;s manner of
life. In November he enters his hunting grounds. After
remaining in one place until he can find no more game, he
removes to another a few miles off, and so continues until the
whole region is explored and the winter months are gone.
Early in March he settles his family in the maple forests,
and while his wife and children are left to make sugar, he enters
alone upon his spring hunt. Returning in May, he takes
his family and pitches his tent in the vicinity of the various
military establishments and trading houses of the wilderness,
where he spends the summer months, feasting, gaming, and
idling away his time. In September he plucks his corn and
gathers his wild rice, and in October prepares himself for
the approaching winter hunt. In the winter they rove about
in companies of about five families, but in summer they congregate
in villages.</p>
<p>A few words as to their ideas of marriage. Each man
is allowed to have as many wives as he can support, and it
is a singular fact that they invariably live together in the
greatest harmony. Those that are young and have no children
are compelled to act (and they do it willingly) as servants
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
to those who are mothers. It is also true that some of
them are allowed to retain their virginity until death.
Though the Chippeways are permitted by their customs to
have a number of wives, they are generally so poor that the
majority of them have only one. When a young man fancies
himself in love, he invites two or three of his companions
to go with him, and they pay a visit to the loved one&rsquo;s lodge.
During this visit not one word is uttered by the guests, and
when they depart the Indian lady is left in doubt as to the
particular one who thus commences his loving attack. On
the succeeding evening, the lover performs his visit alone.
When he enters, if the lady speaks to him, he is accepted;
if not, he is rejected. If the father offers him a lighted
pipe, it is a sign that his consent is granted; if he does not,
and keeps silent, it is understood that the young man must
not persevere. When accepted, the lover makes some rich
presents to the father and mother, and the lovers are considered
husband and wife. Until the bride becomes a mother,
she resides in her father&rsquo;s lodge, and all the game that the
young hunter kills, is given to his wife&rsquo;s parents, but the
furs to his wife. After this, the young woman packs up her
apparel, which is usually her whole fortune, and takes up
her residence with her husband in a new lodge. Divorces
among the Chippeways are hardly ever known, and adultery
is considered a heinous crime, and always punished with the
greatest severity.</p>
<p>Travelling among the Chippeways may be considered a
good deal safer than it is among the <i>half savage</i> inhabitants
of the frontier. The most dangerous to deal with, are the
young men, who, in civilized society, would be called
&ldquo;snobs.&rdquo; They are idle, haughty, and revengeful, and the
only right way to treat them is with the utmost coldness.
Allow them to be familiar, and they will soon be impudent
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and overbearing. Unlike civilized barbarians, those of the
wilderness know not what it is to use profane language.
When they have reason to despise a man, they call him a
bad dog; and when they have chastised such an one, they
wear a skunk skin at one of their heels as a memento
of the mean man&rsquo;s disgrace.</p>
<p>The hospitality of the Chippeways is proverbial. When
a stranger enters their cabin, he is invited to a seat on their
best mat, and always treated with the very best that they
possess in the way of food. Visit a chief at an untimely
hour, at midnight for example, and he will arise, stir up his
fire, and give you a pipe with all the air and politeness of a
polished gentleman. Call upon him, when you know that he
has reason to consider you his enemy, and he will not tell
you to leave his wigwam, but it may be that in an unguarded
moment, when in your own lodge, he will cleave your
skull with a tomahawk. They are also exceedingly affectionate,
and do every thing in their power to make their
children happy. When a party of them are in a state of
starvation, and one individual happens to have a bear or deer,
he will distribute it equally at a <i>feast</i>. They treat their infirm
people with tender care; and never refuse to present to
a brother Indian any pipe, weapon, or ornament that may
have been solicited. They extend the same civility to all
white men whom they esteem. As the Chippeway country
is mostly covered with a dense forest, this people are unacquainted
with the use of the horse. Their mode of hunting
the buffalo has always been to drive them over bluffs,
or to shoot them while disguised in the skin of a wolf or
buffalo. Their only vehicle is the birchen canoe, so famous
for its beautiful model, its frailty and feathery lightness.
The bark of the birch, out of which it is made, is
found in great abundance throughout their entire territory,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and they use it, not only for canoes, but for their lodges,
their grave-houses, their baskets, their mocucks, their dishes,
and exquisitely worked boxes, which they dispose of as curiosities.</p>

<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">In my Canoe</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Elk or Itasca Lake is the fountain head of the Mississippi.
It is thought to be almost three thousand miles from the
Gulf of Mexico and two thousand feet above the level of the
Atlantic. It is a small sheet of water, about five miles
long, one to two miles wide, and contains only one island,
which lies directly in the centre. The first traveller who
visited the lake was Henry R. Schoolcraft, after whom the
island has been justly named. On the south side is a ridge
of wood-crowned hills, which give birth to tiny streams, that
eventually empty their waters into the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans. The whole region on the north is woody, low and
marshy. The water is clear, deep, and full of fish; the
bottom gravelly; and the entire shore covered with reeds and
rushes. The trees which abound here are the pine, oak,
elm, maple, birch, and poplar; and the fish are principally
the trout, pike, and black bass. The Mississippi when it
leaves this lake is only about twenty feet wide, but after passing
through a great number of lakes it spreads itself out to
the width of one hundred and fifty feet, and empties into Red
Cedar Lake. This portion of the Great River might well
be likened to the infant Hercules, for it is the master of
every thing around it, and rambles onward as if conscious
of its dawning power. Upon the whole, however, it is through
a cheerless wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The region of Elk Lake was once famous for the number
of its animals, and derives its name from the following
legend of a mammoth Elk. This creature is said to have
measured the length of two large canoes, and with his horns
had power to split a pine tree. His lair was in a valley
among the neighboring hills, where he reigned supreme;
and it was customary for all the animals of the north, which
were of giant size in those days, to make him an annual
visit. As they were so numerous, they were compelled to
occupy the country for many miles around, which accounts
for its excessive flatness. The object of this &ldquo;world&rsquo;s convention&rdquo;
was to consult the king of beasts as to the forests
and plains they were to occupy during the following year;
and to partake of the water of the small lake, which had
power to protect them from every disease or accident, and
such was the state of things, when an enemy made its appearance,
and the reign of the Emperor Elk was ended.</p>
<p>Those were the days when giants inhabited the earth, and
the region where most they congregated was in the far South.
It so happened that a hunting party of these people wandered
to the North, and finally pitched their tents in the vicinity of
this lake. Among the animals they succeeded in killing
was the Mammoth Elk, which they found asleep, and
pierced with a poisoned arrow. The heavens were immediately
filled with clouds, a heavy rain deluged the earth, and
with their booty, in melancholy mood, the hunters started on
their return. The rain was so abundant that the lake overflowed
its banks, forming a little stream, which finally widened
into a broad river, and emptied into an unknown sea;
and on the bosom of this river did the hunters float in their
newly made canoes, until they found themselves in their own
country. The conclusion of the whole matter was, that from
that year all the animals of the earth began to dwindle in
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
size, and the men of that time were reduced in stature to the
height of their younger children.</p>
<p>A more suggestive legend than the above I have seldom
heard. To my mind, it illustrates the poetical genius of the
Indian, and throws much light upon the history of the Mound
Builders. I obtained it from the lips of an old Indian hermit,
as I sat in his solitary lodge, at the foot of one of the hills
which look down upon Elk Lake.</p>
<p>On the summits of those hills I spent a number of days,
pondering upon the strange wild scenery which surrounded
me. At one time I revelled over a morning landscape.
The sun had just risen above an ocean of forests, and the
sky was echoing with a thousand strains of melody. Earth
was awake, and clothed in her fresh green garment. The
mists had left the long low valleys, and revealed to the open
sky winding rivers and lakes of surpassing loveliness. Every
thing was laughing with joy under the glorious influence of
the summer sun.</p>
<p>The elk and the deer were cropping their morning repast,
with the dew-showers trickling from their sides. Gracefully
did the smoke curl upward from an Indian village.
The hunters were preparing for the chase. I saw them enter
their canoes, silently glide down a river, and finally lose
themselves among the islands of a vast swamp. None were
left in that village but women and children. While the
former busied themselves in their rude occupations, the latter
were sporting in the sunshine, some shooting at a target,
some leaping, some swimming, and others dancing.</p>
<p>A rushing sound now fell upon my ear from a neighboring
thicket. It was a wounded moose that had sought refuge
from a hunter. The arrow had pierced his heart, and,
like an exiled monarch, he had come here to die. He
writhed and bounded in agony. One effort more, and all was
still. The noisy raven was now to feed upon those delicately
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
formed limbs, and pluck from their sockets those eyes,
which were of late so brilliant and full of fire. But after all,
lovely, lovely indeed, was that morning landscape of the pathless
wilderness.</p>
<p>At one time I gazed upon a noontide panorama. Not a
breath of air was stirring, and the atmosphere was hot and
sultry. The leaves and the green waves of the distant prairie
were motionless. The birds were tired of singing, and
had sought the shadowy recesses of the wood. The deer was
quenching his thirst in some nameless stream, or panting
with heat in some secluded dell. On an old dry tree, whose
giant arms stretched upward as if to grasp the clouds, a solitary
bald eagle had perched himself. It was too hot even
for him to enjoy a bath in the upper air; but presently, as if
smitten with a new thought, he spread out his broad pinions,
and slowly ascended to the zenith,&mdash;whence I fancied that
the glance of his keen eyes could rest upon the Atlantic and
Pacific. The butterfly and wild bee were resting on the
full-blown flowers; and perfect silence was in the Indian
village. The children, exhausted with heat and play, had
gone to lie down, some in their cabins, and some in the cool
shadow of the trees. Earth and air were so tranquil, that it
seemed as if nature was offering up a prayer. Winding
far away to the south was the Mississippi, fading away to
the bending sky.</p>
<p>In a few moments a little cloud had obscured the sky.
The wind was rising, and was followed by a roaring sound,&mdash;and
now the storm was spending its fury upon forest and
prairie. The dreadful thunder echoed through the chambers
of the firmament, and the fiercest lightnings flashed forth their
fire. The forests were bending as if every tree would break.
An old oak, which stood in its grandeur upon the plain, now
lay prostrate,&mdash;even as God will sometimes dash to the earth
some proud and insolent man. The parched soil was deluged
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
with rain. But finally the storm had spent its fury, and
the clouds, like a routed army, were passing away in dire
confusion. A rainbow then arched the heavens, and a fresh
but gentle breeze was fanning my cheek, and thrilling my
whole being with rapture.</p>
<p>I also looked upon this wilderness landscape at the evening
hour. As the sun descended, the clouds came out to
meet him, decked in their most gorgeous robes, while the
evening star smiled at his approach. He had left the valleys
in twilight, and I knew that his last beams were gilding
with gold the Rocky Mountains. The moon ascended to her
throne; and the whippoorwill had commenced her evening
hymn. On heavy wings a swan flew past me; she was going
perhaps to her home on the margin of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. A
stir was in the Indian village, for they had returned with
their canoes loaded with game. The customary festival had
commenced, and most strangely did their wild music sound,
as it broke on the surrounding solitude. The doe had gone
to her grassy couch, the feathered multitudes were sleeping,
and the mantle of perfect silence had fallen upon the world.</p>
<p>It was now midnight, and I stood in the centre of an apparently
boundless wilderness of forests and prairies;&mdash;while
far away to the northwest reposed a range of hills, which
seemed to me like a vast caravan of the antediluvian Mound
Builders. The moon had compassed the heavens, and was
near her setting. A thousand stars were by her side. She
flooded with her silver beams the leaves, the waves, and
distant hills. Every voice within the Indian village was
hushed. The warrior, asleep upon his mat, was dreaming
of a new victory lost or won; the youth was dreaming of
the dark-eyed maiden whom he loved; and the child was
dreaming of the toys of yesterday. The pale face had not
yet trespassed upon their rights; and as they were at peace
with the Great Spirit, they were contented and happy. Holy
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
and impressive was the hour. The wind was up, and wailed
an awful anthem as it swept through the dark pines. It
came to my ear like the death-wailings of a world. The
owl was noiselessly flying from tree to tree, and the beautiful
whippoorwill was sleeping. The splash of a leaping trout,
or the howl of a wolf, were the only sounds which fell upon
my ear. I looked, and looked,&mdash;wondering, wondering.
And when I retraced my journey from the summit of the
Elk Hills and the margin of Elk Lake, few and brief were
the words that escaped my lips, for my heart was oppressed
with the majesty of God.</p>

<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">In my Canoe</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Leech Lake lies in the midst of a forest, mostly composed
of pine, maple, oak, elm, and tamarack. It is supposed to
be about forty miles in length, and perhaps twenty to twenty-five
in width. Its shores are very irregular, it contains a
number of large islands, and a trading post of some antiquity.
It derives its name (Casagasque) from the story,
that the first man who discovered it, saw in it a leech, that
was wider across the back than an ordinary Indian mat. It
is deep and clear, has a sandy bottom and shores, and is far-famed
for its white fish, though possessing almost every
other variety in great abundance. Three of its most prominent
islands are known by the names of the Goose, the
Pelican, and the Bear. The first has a desolate appearance,
and is inhabited only by immense numbers of water-fowl;
the second is noted for its fishing grounds, and a
certain species of the pelican said to be found only on its
shores; and the third has a good soil, is thickly wooded, and
somewhat cultivated by a tribe of Indians, who own the lake,
and inhabit the surrounding country.</p>
<p>This tribe of people glory in the name of <i>Pillagers</i>, and
are fully deserving of the name. If they happen to meet
a stranger Indian or Trader, <i>each</i> one will unceremoniously
help himself to an article that he likes, politely remarking
that for <i>his</i> part he desires nothing more, after which they
feed the unfortunate man well, but let him depart with
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
nothing but a blanket or jacket. The Pillagers are a brave,
proud, and warlike people, but on account of their thieving
peculiarity, are universally hated and feared. But they
are good hunters, and pay more attention to agriculture than
any other tribe in the nation.</p>
<p>During my stay at Leech Lake I had an opportunity of
witnessing a Medicine Dance, and of obtaining some information
with regard to the Medicine Society. It is a religious
rite, and practised on a great variety of occasions. At
this time the dance was given by a man who had lost a
relative. The ceremony commenced at twelve o&rsquo;clock at
night, and lasted until the evening of the following day;
and such a perfect mixture of ridiculous dancing, horrible
yelling, and uncouth dressing, I never before witnessed, and
never wish to witness again. It positively seemed as if all
the more unearthly creations of Dante had been let loose
upon the earth, and had sought the heart of the wilderness,
to rejoice at their freedom, and portray the miseries of
hell. I would, but cannot, adequately describe the scene,
and I can only expect my more imaginative readers to obtain
the faintest idea of its strange, strange appearance.</p>
<p>White men and Indians who have never been initiated
into the mysteries of the Grand Medicine, are not allowed
to be present during the first part of the celebration. From
what I have seen and heard about it, I am convinced that it
is nothing in the world but an Indian and <i>savage</i> species of
Free-Masonry. A Medicine man would sooner die, than
divulge the secrets of his order. The ceremony on the
occasion above mentioned, was performed in the immediate
vicinity of the deceased; while a conversation was carried
on with the dead, and food placed by its side, as if it had
been a living and hungry individual. Then it was that
their medicine bags were taken out, and as each Indian has
a certain medicine, or preparation which he supposes his
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
skin to possess, he attempts to manifest its virtues on this
occasion. By breathing into the nostrils of the skin, he
imparts to it a particular charm, by which he can cure the
sick or destroy his enemies. Hence the great fear that
these conjurers inspire in all others. Medicine men support
each other in every thing they may happen individually to
require, even to the murder of an unfortunate child. When
a man has passed the highest degree, he can command the
services of his brethren for any purpose. The price of
admission is six pieces for each grade, and there are eight
grades. By one piece they mean a blanket, a pair of leggins,
a knife, a gun, or any other useful article. The man
who gives the most expensive pieces is highly honored, and
can make the largest demands upon the Society, so that the
older members obtain quite a revenue for their former
expenditures. When they wish to inform a distant lodge of
the faithlessness of a member, they despatch a piece of tobacco;
the guilty man is always known and never admitted,
but when they prove true, their membership is inherited.
The missionaries of the west are inclined to believe that this
Medicine institution is the grand obstacle to the promulgation
of the Christian Religion among the Indians.</p>
<p>I also witnessed while at Leech Lake the <i>conclusion</i> of
a ceremony that was commenced some weeks before. There
had been a Virgin Dance, the prominent features of which
are as follows. All the virgins of the village assemble together
and seat themselves in a large circle. In the midst
of this company are collected all the young men of the village,
who dance for the amusement of the ladies. But if it
so happens that one of the men stops suddenly and points
his finger at a particular girl, she is at once looked upon as
having lost her virginity; if the charge is substantiated the
girl is disgraced, but if not, the young man must <i>die</i>. The
<i>conclusion</i> that I alluded to was, the execution, in cold
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
blood, of a fine looking young man who had attempted, without
cause, to ruin the reputation of a girl by whom he had
been rejected. In an unguarded moment he had been
stabbed, and when I saw him, he was weltering in his blood.
It was a most terrible exhibition of justice and cruelty, and
made me partly admire and then utterly despise the character
of the whole Indian race.</p>
<p>While I was at this lake a couple of trappers made their
appearance from the Red River wilderness, where they had
been hunting during the past winter, but owing to an accident
had been detained from returning until the present
time. They were Half-Breeds, and as wild a pair of beings
as I ever beheld. Their furs, at the usual prices, would
probably bring them some fifteen hundred dollars. Their
place of destination was St. Louis, where each one had a
wife and children. Their intention was to remain with their
friends until November, when they would dive into the
wilderness again.</p>
<p>I only heard three legends at Leech Lake. One gives
the origin of a certain miniature whirlpool, which may be
seen on the south side of the lake. A couple of Chippeway
women, while crossing in a canoe, were pursued by Sioux
Indians, but the Lake Spirit, out of compassion for their misfortune,
struck the water with his wings and opened an easy
pathway to the Spirit Land. The second story is about
Pelican Island. It is said that no Indian ever visited it
without being caught in a storm; and that it has for centuries
been inhabited by strange people. They were never
visible excepting from the main shore, for when the island
was searched no tracks or wigwam-poles could be seen,
nothing but rocks, grass, and reeds. At the present time,
none but the bravest dare land upon its shore with their
canoes.</p>
<p>The third legend that I heard on the borders of this lake
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
was about a famous battle once fought, between the gods of
the white man and the red man. A great many summers
ago, a race of white people made their appearance on the
shores of this country, and, as they were a strange people,
the red men of the wilderness were disposed to love them.
As the former were very poor, the latter presented them
with a few acres of land to cultivate. As the white men increased
in numbers, they craved more land, but the red
men would not yield to their extravagant solicitations. In
the mean time the strange people were becoming powerful.
In process of time the Big Manito became displeased with
them, and was determined that this usurpation should cease.
He visited the white man&rsquo;s god, and told him that he must
take back his ambitious children. The white man&rsquo;s god
replied that he would do no such thing, but was determined
to protect his own. Manito then told him that the question
must be decided by battle. A famous battle was fought,
and the white man&rsquo;s god triumphed. He took Manito
prisoner, and tied him to an oak with hickory saplings, but
he finally made his escape, and with his children took up his
home in the more remote wilderness.</p>
<p>The region of Leech Lake is somewhat famous for the
quantity and good quality of the original maize or Indian
corn. When I was there it was not sufficiently advanced
to be eaten, even in a green state, but I obtained a fact with
regard to corn planting, which may be new to my readers.
All the labor connected with the raising of corn is performed
by the women, who take it upon themselves as an offset to the
hardships endured by the men in hunting. It is customary
for them after they have planted the seed, to perform, in a
state of nudity, a nocturnal walk through the field, which
ceremony is supposed to protect the grain from the destroying
insect or worm.</p>
<p>During my stay at this lake I received from my friend
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
Morrison, the following facts with regard to the game now
inhabiting this region. The black bear, the black and gray
wolf, the elk, the moose, and the deer, the otter, the mink,
porcupine, white fisher, fox, the coon, the martin, the rabbit
and a variety of squirrels are as abundant as ever; the
grisly bear and buffalo are found only occasionally; and
the beaver is entirely extinct. Among the birds that I saw
were eagles, fish-hawks, night-hawks, owls, loons, the
swan, the crane, a great variety of ducks, the pigeon, the
woodpecker, blue-jay, black and blue-bird, red-bird, and the
king-bird; and among the fish that may be found in Leech
Lake, are the white-fish, the trout, the pike, the pickerel,
the bass, the sucker, and the mullet. It is said the white-fish
of this lake, originated from the brains of a woman; and
I am also told that its shores have in times past yielded more
wealth in the way of furs than any other place of the same
extent in the northwest. But enough. It is time that I should
close this desultory paper, else my reader will accuse me of
practising the most prominent peculiarity of the <i>animal
Leech</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">In my Canoe</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>This is to be my last letter from the Mississippi valley,
and my passion for the gentle art of angling, will not allow
me to leave the great river without recounting a few fishing
paragraphs, as mementoes of my journey thus far.</p>
<p>The largest and unquestionably the most abundant variety
of fish found in the Lower Mississippi is the cat-fish, and
here I believe they are found in the greatest perfection. They
vary from one to six feet in length, and in weight from
three to one hundred and fifty pounds. As an article of food
they do not amount to much, and yet I have met with many
people who considered them a great delicacy. They are invariably
taken with the hook, and to those who admire muddy
water, and love to handle the ugliest of creatures, capturing
them must be a fascinating amusement. They are caught
and eaten at all seasons of the year.</p>
<p>Another fish which abounds in the turbid portion of the
Mississippi is called by the western people a perch, but is in
fact only a sheep&rsquo;s-head. They are most abundant in the
spring. They vary from one to eight pounds in weight, and
as an article of food are about on a par with cat-fish. The
above mentioned fish are the principal varieties which may
be said to flourish in the Lower Mississippi; it is true, however,
that specimens of almost every species of fresh water
fish are occasionally taken. The baits used for the cat-fish
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
and sheep&rsquo;s-head are pieces of fresh meat. Almost every
steamboat on the river is well supplied with cotton lines and
common hooks, and the principal anglers for this fish are
steamboat hands and raftmen.</p>
<p>But I must confess that I made a number of attempts to
capture one of these monsters. The adventure took place
after the following manner. Our boat had stopped at Alton
in the evening, and was to remain there until about midnight.
The river was without a ripple, and the marvellous beauty
of the surrounding landscape threw me into a romantic mood;
and tipping the wink to one of my companions to accompany
me, we took an assortment of tackle with about two pounds
of beef, and jumped into a skiff for an hour&rsquo;s sport. We
pulled for the opposite side of the river, and having moored
our shallop at the mouth of a bayou, baited our hooks, and
threw them in. We had sat in silence just long enough to
watch the shooting into darkness of a star, when my line was
suddenly made taught, and I knew that I had a prize. I
gave the fellow about one hundred feet of line, and he made
use of his &ldquo;largest liberty&rdquo; by swimming around a certain
snag, which of course made me a little angry, but greatly
increased my excitement. I managed, however, to disentangle
my victim after a while, and in due time had him safely
ensconced in the bottom of the boat. His length was nearly
four feet, and his weight must have been upwards of sixty
pounds. While we were recrossing the river to reach our
steamboat, a savage little steamer from Keokuck came rushing
down, ahead of another with which it was racing, and
passed so very near our shallop that we were swamped, and
while my companion and myself were swimming to the shore
for dear life, the monster we had captured was probably
scooting away towards the Torrid Zone, not much injured,
but a good deal frightened. About two hours after that adventure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
I was the victim of a most painful nightmare, for I
dreamed that I was dying from strangulation.</p>
<p>Before taking my leave of the cat-fish I must transcribe
a description of him as recorded by Father Marquette:&mdash;&ldquo;We
saw also a very hideous sea monster; his head was like that
of a tiger, but his nose was somewhat sharper, and like a
wild-cat; his beard was long, his ears stood upright, the
color of his head being gray and neck black. He looked
upon us for some time; but as we came near him, our oars
frightened him away.&rdquo; This is about as near the truth as
Marquette ever arrived, but every one acquainted with the
cat-fish of the Mississippi will readily perceive the resemblance
of the description to the original.</p>
<p>I would now descant upon the fish of the Upper Mississippi.
The largest is the sturgeon, of which there are two varieties,
the common and the long-billed sturgeon. They
constitute a staple article of food with the Indians, who take
them with gill-nets and the spear. Their manner of preserving
them is by drying and smoking. In size they vary
from three to eight feet in length, weighing from thirty to
one hundred and thirty pounds. Like all the larger fish of
the Mississippi, their flavor is far from being delicate. With
the sturgeon, which is a plebeian fish, I am disposed to class
the mullet, sucker, rock-bass, sun-fish, bill-fish, bull-head,
and chub, and can affirm from personal knowledge that all
these fish are abundant in the Mississippi.</p>
<p>They are in their prime in the spring, but very few of
them are fit to eat in the summer. With the Indians, however,
they are eaten at all seasons, and I have never yet seen
a fish in their country which they did not use as an article
of food. Pickerel and perch also abound in all the waters of
this region, but I do not consider them equal to the same varieties
in New England. All the larger lakes which help to
swell the Upper Mississippi are well supplied with white-fish,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
the best of which are found in Leech Lake. As an article
of food they excel all the fish of the northwest, but as they
are of the shad genus, the angler can only praise them in the
abstract.</p>
<p>The Indians employ a great variety of modes for taking
all these fish, but the gill-net, the spear, and the bow and
arrow are the more successful ones.</p>
<p>But the regular game fish of the Upper Mississippi, are
the muskalounge, pike, black bass, and trout; and of these
it always affords me unfeigned pleasure to discourse. The
two former varieties are so nearly alike in appearance and
habits that I am disposed to speak of them as one and the
same thing. Formerly I entertained the opinion that a muskalounge
was only an overgrown pike, but within the past year
I have compared them together, and am convinced that they
are materially different. Their habits, however, are precisely
alike. They are exceedingly abundant in the sluggish
waters of the Mississippi, and vary from five to fifty pounds
in weight. They are in season about nine months of the
year, but in the spring, at which time they ascend the river
to spawn, are in their prime. It is well known that these
fish are bold biters; but the pike is unquestionably the most
active and cunning of the two, and consequently the most
valuable to the angler. The muskalounge is somewhat
of a sluggard, and owing to his size and hyena-like character,
the very fish of all others for spearing by torchlight.
The handsomest pike I ever had the pleasure of capturing
was a resident of Lake Pepin. I was sauntering along the
base of one of the rocky bluffs of this beautiful sheet of
water, and had spent most of the day without success, trying
to take a trout with a mammoth fly. I had thrown out my
line for the last time, when, as I was carelessly winding it
up, I was astonished by a sudden leap within twenty feet of
me, and in a moment more it was whizzing through the water
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
in fine style. I humored the gentleman for about ten minutes,
leading him meanwhile towards a sand-bar, where I
secured and placed him in my canoe. He weighed upwards
of twenty-one pounds, was very fat, had a black back and
silvery belly.</p>
<p>My best muskalounge fishing occurred at a bend in the
Mississippi, about one hundred and fifty miles above the
Falls of Saint Anthony. I took them with a spear and by
torch-light, standing in the bow of a canoe which was propelled
by an Indian. Noiselessly did our birchen torch glide
into a thousand nooks of the stream, like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp,
with a couple of deluded followers. I took no note of time
on that memorable occasion, and the only thing which prevented
me from fishing until morning, was the fog which
covered the river about midnight. We landed, however,
with a sufficient quantity of fish to supply the whole encampment
of Indians for at least three days, and among them
were seven specimens of the muskalounge,&mdash;the remainder
being composed of small fry in general. On opening one of
my prizes, an immense black-snake was found in his bowels,
from which time I date my antipathy to this fishy genus as
an article of food.</p>
<p>The best, and one of the most universal fish of the Mississippi,
is the black bass. They vary from one to seven
pounds in weight, are taken with the fly, the minnow and
the frog, and in my opinion, as a game fish, are only second
to the trout. They are found in great abundance at all the
rapids in the river, but afforded me the finest sport at the
Falls of Saint Anthony. When I was there the water was
uncommonly low, so that pool fishing was in its prime, and I
enjoyed it to perfection. If I thought that my word would
not be doubted, I should be pleased to mention the fact, that
on one occasion I captured no less than thirty-five superb
bass in the space of two hours, and that too, without once
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
moving the anchor of my boat. I took them with a hand-line,
baiting with a minnow, and the majority of them weighed
over three pounds apiece.</p>
<p>The only respectable trout region of the Mississippi
extends from Prairie Du Chien to Lake St. Croix. An
expert angler may here capture an occasional pounder, out
of the river itself; but the rarest of sport is afforded by all
the neighboring brooks, which run through a hilly country,
and are rapid, rocky, and clear. The trout of these streams
average about eight ounces in weight. As I sailed up the
Alpine portion of the river in a steamboat, my opportunities
for wetting the line were not frequent or particularly successful,
as the following illustration will testify.</p>
<p>I had just arisen from the breakfast table, when the pilot
of the boat informed me that he was about to be delayed for
two hours, and that there was a fine trout stream a little
farther on, which I might investigate. I immediately hailed
a couple of my travelling companions, and with our rods in
prime order, we all started for the unknown stream. Owing
to a huge rock that lay on the margin of the river, we were
compelled to make an extensive circuit over a number of
brier-covered hills, and we found the bed of our pilot&rsquo;s trout
brook without a particle of water. What aggravated our
miserable condition was the intense heat of the sun, which
shot its fiery arrows into our very brains. In about an hour,
however, we succeeded in reaching the Mississippi once
more, and there, comfortably seated in the shadow of a bluff,
we threw out our lines and awaited the arrival of the boat.
We happened to be in the vicinity of a deep hole, out of
which we brought five black bass, weighing three and four
pounds apiece. We did not actually capture a single trout,
but the sight of one immense fellow that I <i>lost</i> almost brought
upon me a fit of sickness. Something very heavy had seized
my hook, and after playing it for some minutes I was about
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
to land it, when I saw that it was a trout, (it must have
weighed some three pounds,) but making a sudden leap, it
snapped my line, and was, like a great many objects in this
world, entirely out of my reach; and then I was the victim
of a loud and long laugh. The only thing that kept me
from falling into a settled melancholy was the incident
which immediately followed. When the boat came along,
a Frenchman who was a passenger, and happened to have a
canoe floating at the stern, volunteered his services to take
us on board the steamer. Knowing that my friends had
never been in a canoe before, I would not embark with them,
and in about two minutes I had the <i>pleasure</i> of seeing them
capsized, and after they had become completely soaked, of
seeing them rescued from all danger, minus the three fine
bass which they had taken. This feat was performed in
the presence of quite a number of ladies, and to the tune of
as satisfactory a laugh as I ever enjoyed.</p>

<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">St. Louis River</span>, July, 1846.</span></p>
<p>I now write you from the margin of a stream which
empties into Lake Superior, towards which I am impatiently
pursuing my way. Sandy Lake, where ended my voyaging
on the Mississippi, is one of the most famous lakes of the
northwest. It lies only about three miles east of the great
river, and almost directly west from Lake Superior. Over
the intervening route which connects the two water wonders
of our country, more furs and Indian goods have been transported,
than over any other trail in the wilderness. The
lake received its name from the French, on account of its
sandy shores, which are remarkably beautiful, abounding in
agates and cornelians. There is a trading post here, which
is said to have been established ninety years ago; and in a
certain log cabin which was pointed out to me, I was told
furs had been stored, to the value of fifty millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The shores of this lake are hilly, and being full of beautiful
islands, it presents a most interesting appearance. The
water is clear and abounds in fish, of which the black bass,
the pike and white-fish are the most abundant.</p>
<p>The voyager in pursuing this route always finds it necessary
to make a number of portages. The original manner
in which I performed one of these I will briefly describe.</p>
<p>When the company to which I belonged had landed on
the eastern shore of Sandy Lake, I immediately inquired for
the trail, seized my gun and started on ahead, hoping that I
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
might succeed in killing a few pigeons for supper. The
path was well beaten, the scenery interesting, and I went on
with a light heart and a head full of fantastic images born of
the wild forest. The only creature in the way of game that
I saw was a large red deer, which suddenly startled me by
a shrill snort, and bounded away as if in scorn of my locomotive
powers. Soon as my <i>hair</i> was fairly settled to its
natural smoothness on my head, (how very uncomfortable it
is to be frightened!) the deer made a dignified pause, and I
attempted to draw near by dodging along behind the trees.</p>
<p>Soon as I was through dodging, I looked up and found
that my game was missing, and I therefore wheeled about to
resume my journey. My intention was reasonable and lawful,
but then arose the thought, what direction shall I pursue?
The more I pondered the more my wonder grew, and after
a series of ineffectual rambles I finally concluded that I had
lost my way, and must spend the night, literally speaking,
&ldquo;in the wilderness alone.&rdquo; I now record my tale without
a particle of emotion, but I can tell you that my feelings and
reflections on that occasion were uncomfortable in the extreme.</p>
<p>After wandering about the woods until my feet were
blistered, I concluded to pitch my tent for the night, although
the only things I had with me to make me comfortable in my
solitude, were an unloaded gun, a horn half full of powder,
and my shot-bag, empty of shot and balls. I happened to be
in a deep valley, which was entirely covered with pine trees.
One of them had two large branches that shot out together
about a dozen feet from the ground, and as I had no sure
way of keeping off an enemy, I managed to climb up to them,
and there spent the night, without once budging from my interesting
roost.</p>
<p>I was not visited by any goblins on that memorable night,
but the actual miseries which ministered to me during the dark
hours were quite numerous. In the first place, I had to
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
watch the deepening shadows of the evening, tormented by
hunger and thirst. Instead of having an opportunity to satisfy
my own appetite, it seemed as if all the musketoes of
the wilderness had assembled together for the purpose of
having a feast on my own flesh and blood. But nature
granted me a brief respite from this torment, by causing a
heavy shower to fall, which had a tendency to cool my feverish
lips and brow, and allowed me a lucid interval of sleep.</p>
<p>But this blessedness was soon ended, for in a fit of the
night-mare I had a very narrow escape from falling to the
ground. After I had fairly recovered myself, and again
drank in the horrors of a musketo dirge, I almost made up
my mind to drop at any rate, and thereby end my life and
the enjoyment of my infernal enemies.</p>
<p>But there was soon another change in the character of
my miseries. An immense owl had the impudence to perch
himself on a limb above my head, whence he poured forth a
flood of the most horrible screaming that mortal ever heard.
Soon as the echoes thus awakened had melted into silence, a
crackling sound fell upon my ear, and I beheld an old bear,
straggling along, as if he was sure of enjoying a feast of
fresh meat.</p>
<p>He halted and snuffed around the base of a tree, which
stood only a few yards distant from the one I occupied, and
then continued on his way. He seemed to know that human
feet had lately trodden the valley, but rationally concluding
that no sensible man would remain in that particular region
any longer than he could possibly help it, he did not trouble
himself about the scent he had discovered. I felt grateful
towards the old savage for his unintentional politeness, but if
my gun had been loaded with only one ball, I should have
favored him with an unexpected salute.</p>
<p>The hours which followed this event, and preceded the
dawn, were the longest that I ever experienced. My wretchedness
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
was indescribable; I was cold and hungry, and in a
perfect fever, from want of sleep, and the insect poison infused
into my whole body; but morning came at last, and
with it the warm bright sunshine and the silence of the Sabbath;
only a loud clear chorus of sweetest melody echoed
through the pine forest valley, from the throats of a thousand
feathered minstrels.</p>
<p>On descending from my elevated position, I ascended a
high hill, from whose summit I could look down upon a
beautiful lake, where I saw my fellow travellers all quietly
afloat in their canoes. I loaded my gun with powder and
fired a signal, which was answered by a deafening shout,
that was far sweeter to my ears at that particular moment
than even the song of birds. When the Indians who had been
hunting after me had returned, and when I resumed my seat
in the canoe, and had a slice of cold pork between my fingers,
I was perfectly happy, in spite of the many jokes
cracked at my expense.</p>

<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Mouth of the Saint Louis</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>By looking on the map you will observe that this river
enters Lake Superior on the extreme west. I had not the
means of ascertaining its precise length, but was told that
above the Savannah, where I struck it, it is an inconsiderable
stream. From that point to the lake it is quite a majestic
river, and I should suppose the distance to be nearly one
hundred and fifty miles. It has more the appearance of a
wild New England river than any other that I have seen in
the western country. It is exceedingly rocky, and so full of
sunken boulders and dangerous rapids, that it never could be
made navigable further up than Fon du Lac, which is twenty
miles from Lake Superior. The water is perfectly clear,
but of a rich snuff color, owing probably to the swamps out
of which it runs. It is said to rise and fall very suddenly.
Its entire shores are without a solitary habitation (excepting
at the trading post already mentioned), and the scenery is
picturesque, wild and romantic. But I hear the roar of its
glorious cataracts, and must attempt a description of them.</p>
<p>There is a place on this river called the Knife Portage,
from the fact that the rocks here are exceedingly sharp and
pointed, where the stream forms a large bend, and where the
voyager has to make a portage of twelve miles. The length
of this bend may be sixteen miles, and in that distance the
water has a fall of about three hundred and twenty feet.
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
The width of the river may be from three to four hundred
yards. At this point (just above Fon du Lac) are three
nameless waterfalls, whose dimensions are indeed stupendous:
they are said to be the largest in the northwest. The water
of the first tumbles over a pile of pointed rocks, and after
twisting itself into every possible variety of schutes and
foaming streams, finally murmurs itself to sleep in a pool
eighty feet below the summit whence it takes its first leap.</p>
<p>The second fall, or rather cataract, is about one hundred
and forty feet high, nearly perpendicular, and the water
rushes over almost in a solid and unbroken body.</p>
<p>The walls of slate on either side are lofty, and &ldquo;crowned
with a peculiar diadem of trees;&rdquo; and as the roaring of the
fall is perfectly deafening, its effect upon me was allied to
that of Niagara. The pools at the bottom appeared to be black
and fathomless, but the spray was whiter than snow, and the
rainbows beautiful beyond comparison. When I gazed upon
the features of this superb water-wonder, united as they were
in one complete picture; when I listened to the scream of an
hundred eagles mingling with its roar, and thought of the
uninhabited wilderness in every direction around me, I
was most deeply impressed with the power of the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>I visited this cataract accompanied by a party of Indians,
and owing to the length of time it took us to reach it, we
were compelled to spend the night in its immediate vicinity.
And then it was that the effect of this cataract upon my mind
was so impressive as actually, at times, to be exceedingly
painful. We built our watch-fire on the southern shore, in a
sheltering bay, about one hundred yards from the fall, and
on a spot where we could command a complete view of the
superb picture.</p>
<p>Our supper on that occasion was composed exclusively
of venison, as one of the party had succeeded in killing a
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
deer in one of his morning excursions; and though I had
not eaten for nine or ten hours, I seemed to have lost my appetite,
and took my food merely as a matter of necessity;&mdash;the
fact was, I thought myself the inhabitant of a &ldquo;fantastic
realm,&rdquo; and could hardly feel that I was a mere mortal, the
creature of an hour. After our repast was ended, two of
the Indians lighted their birchen torches and jumped into a
canoe for the purpose of spearing fish. I watched them
with peculiar interest, and saw them perform one feat which
was truly wonderful. They had wounded an immense pike
on a shoal, very near a column of the falling element, when
the stricken creature floundered away into the foaming water,
and the canoe darted on in quick pursuit, as if its inmates
were determined to capture or die. One moment it
seemed as if the torrent of water must be pouring into the
canoe, and the torches be extinguished, and then again, I
could only see a halo of light, looking like the sun rising at
midnight, as the fishermen glided behind a sheet of water or
a cloud of spray. They were successful in their sport, and
finally returned and presented their prize at my feet. The
party then enjoyed a pipe for about twenty minutes, when
the younger Indians commenced playing their favorite moccason
game, and I spent the remainder of the evening conversing
with the chief and patriarch of the band, from whom I
gathered the following tradition respecting the cataract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More moons ago than I can count,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;the country lying between the big lake (Superior) and the
place where the sun goes down, was owned by the Sioux nation,
which was then immensely powerful. They were very
cruel in their warfare, and did every thing in their power to
annihilate the Chippeway nation. The Great Spirit was not
their friend, but ours, and once, when a multitude of their
warriors were pursuing some of our hunters down the river,
the Great Spirit suddenly <i>kicked out the bottom</i> in this place,
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
and the principal enemies of our nation were all destroyed.
Since that time we have been the possessors of this vast country,
and the children of our ancient enemies catch the buffalo
in a far distant prairie land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this legend deeply impressed on my brain (the
telling of which occupied my companion for nearly two
hours) I ordered more wood to be placed on the fire, and
leaving the others to take care of themselves, rolled myself
up in my blanket, and was soon asleep. I was awakened
only once during the night, and that was by the distant howl
of a wolf, mingling with the solemn anthem of the cataract.
I sat up for a moment to look upon the scene, but the sky
was covered with clouds, and it was exceedingly dark. Even
the embers of our watch-fire had ceased blazing. Around
me lay my companions in a deep sleep. Once more did I
listen to that dreadful howl, and that Godlike voice of many
waters, until, like a frightened child, I hastily covered my
head, and wept myself to sleep. On the following morning
we resumed our journey in the midst of a rain storm, the
memory of that night and that cataract, however, haunting
me like a dream.</p>
<p>The next perpendicular fall within the bend I have mentioned,
is some two miles down the stream, and is only about
fifty feet in height, but its grandeur is somewhat enhanced
by the rapids which succeed it, and have a fall of some forty
or fifty feet more. An old trader tells me that I am the first
traveller from the states who has ever taken the trouble
actually to visit these cataracts. If this is a fact, and as the
Indians, so far as I can learn, have never christened them, I
claim the privilege of giving them a name. Let them, then,
be known hereafter as the Chippeway Falls. It is a singular
circumstance that a pine tree might be cut in this interior
wilderness, and if launched in one of the tributaries of the
Mississippi, or in the Saint Louis River, and propelled by
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
favorable winds alone, could, in process of time, be planted
in the hull of a ship at any sea-port on the globe.</p>
<p>The navigable portion of the Saint Louis, as before remarked,
extends only about twenty miles from the Lake, at
which point is the place legitimately called Fon du Lac. It
is an ancient trading post, and contains about half a dozen
white inhabitants, viz., a worthy missionary and his interesting
family. The agent of the Fur Company and his assistants
are half-breeds, and a most godless set of people they
are. It is a general rendezvous for several Indian tribes,
and when I was there was quite crowded with the barbarians.</p>
<p>Fon du Lac, so far as the scenery is concerned, is one
of the most truly delightful places that I ever met with in my
life. The first white man who traded here was my friend
Morrison, after whom the highest hill in the vicinity was
named. Upon this eminence I spent a pleasant afternoon
revelling over a landscape of surpassing loveliness. Far
below me lay an extensive natural meadow, on the left of
which was a pretty lake, and on the right a little hamlet
composed of log cabins and bark wigwams. The broad valley
of the Saint Louis faded away to the east, studded with
islands, and protected on either side by a range of high wood-crowned
hills, beyond which reposed in its conscious pride
the mighty lake-wonder of the world. The atmosphere
which rested upon the whole scene seemed to halo every
feature, and with the occasional tinkling of a solitary cow-bell,
combined to fill my heart with an indescribable joy.</p>
<p>Most of my rambles about this place were performed in
company with the missionary already mentioned. He informed
me that the surrounding country abounded in rich
copper ore, in agates and cornelians of the first water, and
that all the smaller streams of the country afforded rare
trout fishing. If this end of Lake Superior should become,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
as I doubt not it will, famous for its mines, Fon du Lac would
be a most agreeable place to reside in, as it is easily reached
by vessels. I was hospitably entertained by this gentleman,
and could not but contrast the appearance of his dwelling
with that of his neighbor the French trader. In the one you
might see a small library, a large family Bible, the floor covered
with matting, &amp;c., a neat, tidy, and intelligent wife and
children; in the other, a pack of cards, a barrel of whisky,
a stack of guns, and a family whose filthiness was only
equalled by the total ignorance of its various members. And
this contrast only inadequately portrays the difference between
Christianity and heathenism.</p>
<p>I left Fon du Lac about day-break, and with a retinue of
some twenty canoes, which were freighted with Indians bound
to a payment at La Pointe. It was one of those misty summer
mornings when every object in nature wears a bewitching
aspect, and her still small voice seems to whisper to the
heart that it is not the &ldquo;whole of life to live, nor the whole
of death to die,&rdquo; and when we feel that God is omnipotent
and the mind immortal. But the scenery of this portion of
the river is beautiful&mdash;beautiful beyond any thing I had imagined
to exist in any country on the globe. The entire
distance from Fon du Lac to this place, as before mentioned,
is not far from twenty miles. The river is very broad and
deep and completely filled with wooded islands, while on
either side extends a range of mountains which are as wild
and solitary, as when brought into existence.</p>
<p>Every member of the voyaging party seemed to be perfectly
happy, and we travelled at our ease, for the purpose
of prolonging the enjoyment of the voyage. At one time
we landed at the base of a cliff, and while I made a drawing
or ransacked the shore for agates and cornelians, and the
young Indians clambered up a hillside for roots or berries,
the more venerable personages of the party would sit in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
canoes, quietly puffing away at their pipes as they watched
the movements of their younger companions. Ever and
anon might be heard the report of a gun, or the whiz of an
arrow, as we happened to pass the feeding place of a flock
of ducks, the nest of an eagle or raven, or the marshy haunt
of a muskrat or otter. Now we surprised a couple of deer
swimming across the river, one of which the Indians succeeded
in capturing; and now we hauled up our canoes on
a sandy island, to have a talk with some lonely Indian
family, the smoke of whose wigwam had attracted our attention,
rising from between the trees. Our sail down the river
occupied us until about ten o&rsquo;clock, when we reached the
mouth of the river, and disembarked for the purpose of preparing
and eating our breakfast. We landed on the river
side of a long sandy point, and while the Indians were cooking
a venison steak and a large trout, I rambled over the
sand hills, and as the sun came out of a cloud and dissipated
every vestige of the morning mist, obtained my first view of
Lake Superior, where, above the apparently boundless plain
I could only discover an occasional gull wheeling to and fro
as if sporting with the sunbeams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault St. Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>I have finished my pilgrimage around the shores of Lake
Superior, given away my birchen canoe, and parted with
my Indian guides and fellow-voyagers. It now remains for
me to mould into an intelligible form the notes which I
have recorded from time to time, while seated in my canoe
or lounging beside the watch-fires of my barbarous companions.</p>
<p>Lake Superior, known to be the largest body of fresh
water on the globe, is not far from four hundred miles long
from east to west, and one hundred and thirty wide. It is the
grand reservoir whence proceed the waters of Michigan,
Huron, and Erie; it gives birth to Niagara, the wonder of
the world, fills the basin of Ontario, and rolls a mighty flood
down the valley of the Saint Lawrence to the Atlantic. It
lies in the bosom of a mountainous land, where the red man
yet reigns in his native freedom. Excepting an occasional
picketed fort or trading house, it is yet a perfect wilderness.
The entire country is rocky and covered with a stunted
growth of vegetation, where the silver fur, the pine, hemlock,
the cedar and the birch are most abundant. The soil is
principally composed of a reddish clay, which becomes
almost as hard as brick on being exposed to the action of the
air and sun. In some of the valleys, however, the soil is
rich and suitable for purposes of agriculture.</p>
<p>The waters of this magnificent lake are marvellously
clear, and even at midsummer are exceedingly cold. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
passing along its rocky shores in my frail canoe, I have often
been alarmed at the sight of a sunken boulder, which I fancied
must be near the top, and on further investigation have
found myself to be upwards of twenty feet from the danger
of a concussion; and I have frequently lowered a white rag
to the depth of one hundred feet, and been able to discern its
every fold or stain. The color of the water near the shore
is a deep green, but off soundings it has all the dark blue
appearance of the ocean. The sandy shores are more abrupt
than those of any body of water I have ever seen; and within
a few feet of many of its innumerable bluffs, it would be
impossible for a ship to anchor. It is a singular fact that
the waters of this lake are much heavier than those of Huron,
which are also heavier than those of Erie and Michigan. I
am informed on the best authority that a loaded canoe will
draw at least two inches more water in Huron than in Superior.</p>
<p>The natural harbors of this lake are not numerous, but
on account of its extent and depth it affords an abundance of
sea room, and is consequently one of the safest of the great
lakes to navigate. The only trouble is that it is subject to
severe storms, which arise very suddenly. Often have I
floated on its sleeping bosom in my canoe at noonday, and
watched the butterfly sporting in the sunbeams; and at the
sunset hour of the same day, have stood in perfect terror
upon the rocky shore, gazing upon the mighty billows
careering onward as if mad with a wild delight, while a
wailing song, mingled with the &ldquo;trampling surf,&rdquo; would
ascend to the gloomy sky. The shipping of the lake at the
present time is composed of one steamboat, one propeller,
and several small schooners, which are chiefly supported by
the fur and copper business.</p>
<p>And now a word or two about the climate of this region.
The winters are very long, averaging about seven months,
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
while spring, summer and autumn are compelled to fulfill
their duties in the remaining five. During the former
season the snow frequently covers the whole country to the
depth of three, four and five feet, but the cold is regular and
consequently healthful. The few white people who spend
their winters in this remote region are almost as isolated as
the inhabitants of Greenland. The only news which they
then obtain from the civilized world, is brought them once
a month. The mail-carriers are half-breeds or Indians, who
travel through the pathless wilderness in a rude sledge drawn
by dogs. But the climate of Lake Superior at midsummer
is delightful beyond compare; the air is soft and bracing at
the same time. A healthier region does not exist on the
earth, I verily believe, and this assertion is corroborated by
the well known fact that the inhabitants usually live to an
advanced age, in spite of their many hardships. The common
diseases of mankind are here comparatively unknown,
and I have never seen an individual whose breast did not
swell with a new emotion of delight as he inhaled the air of
this northern wilderness.</p>
<p>Before concluding this general description of the region
I have recently explored, I ought to speak of the game which
is found here. Of the larger animals the two principal species
are the black bear and elk, but they are far from being
abundant; of the smaller varieties, almost every northern
animal may be found, excepting the beaver, which has
become extinct. Waterfowl, as many people suppose, are
not abundant, for the reason that the rocky bottom of the
lake yields no plants to supply them with food; but westward
of Superior, about the head waters of the Saint Louis
and Mississippi, they are found in incredible numbers. As
to snakes, you might travel a thousand miles through the
woods and not see a single specimen. They are not &ldquo;native
and to the manor born.&rdquo; The traveller through this region
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
finds but little use for his guns and rifles; if, however, he
is not too devoted a worshipper of mammon, he may bring
with him any quantity of fishing tackle, and his brightest
anticipations with regard to angling will be fully realized.
But I must be more particular in my descriptions, and will
therefore make the American and Canadian shores of Lake
Superior the theme of my two next chapters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault Saint Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>It is computed that the American coast of Lake Superior
extends to about twice the length of that which belongs to
Canada. Our portion of the northern shore is skirted by a
range of mountains which seem to be from two to three
thousand feet in height; and it is said they extend in an unbroken
chain from the river Saint Louis to the gulf of Saint
Lawrence. Though they abound in cliffs, caverns, and waterfalls,
when seen from the water, &ldquo;distance lends enchantment&rdquo;
to these mountains, and they fade away, swell beyond
swell, like the rolling billows of the ocean, while an occasional
cloud will rest upon them, as if to remind the beholder
of a ship, and thus complete the illusion. On the southern
shore of the lake is a range called the Porcupine Mountains,
which appear to be about as extensive (but not so lofty) as
the Catskills; their varying outlines, seen as you sail along
the coast, are very beautiful indeed. Point Keweenaw is
also covered with hills, but less lofty and picturesque than
those already mentioned. That portion of the coast lying
between this point and the river Saint Mary, is low, and with
the exception of the Pictured Rocks, uninteresting. Though
our shores are not, generally speaking, what we should call
rocky, yet they are distinguished for a variety of remarkable
bluffs. Those alluded to above, are found on the east of
Point Keweenaw, and extend along the coast some nine miles.
They have been striped with various colors by mineral alluviations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
and are about one hundred and fifty feet high. The
most conspicuous of them is perhaps three hundred feet high,
but its most superb feature was demolished by a storm in the
year 1816. That feature, according to a drawing in my
possession, was an arch or doorway, fifteen feet broad and
one hundred high, through which the Indians were accustomed
to pass with their canoes. In those days, too, from
the crevices in these solid walls of whitish sandstone leaped
forth beautiful cascades, and mingled their waters with those
of the lake. Beautiful caverns meet the eye in every direction,
and the water at their base is of a deep green, and in
some places almost fathomless.</p>
<p>A cluster of rocks similar to the above is found westward
of the Apostle Islands. These, however, are composed
of a deep red sandstone, and are only about one hundred
feet high, extending along the shore for about two miles.
The arches here are almost numberless, and exceedingly
picturesque and singular, and you may wind your way among
them in a canoe without the least danger, provided you have
a steady hand and sufficient nerve. And the caverns, too, in
these bluffs are also very numerous, and some of them are
so deep and dark that the eye cannot measure their depths,&mdash;and
from these gloomy recesses, &ldquo;even in a season of calm
weather,&rdquo; always issues a sound like thunder, which must be
perfectly terrific when a storm is raging. All these bluffs
are covered with a stunted growth of Alpine and other trees.</p>
<p>The largest island in Lake Superior belongs to the
American government, and is called Isle Royal. It is forty
miles long, and varies from six to ten miles in width. Its
hills have an altitude of four hundred feet, it is covered
with forest, and has a bold shore. During the winter it is
entirely uninhabited, but for the two last summers has been
thoroughly explored by the copper speculators. The northern
side is bold and rocky, but the southern shore has a number
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
of fine bays and natural harbors. The soil is barren,
but distinguished for its fishing grounds. According to
the Indians, it is the home of all the spirits of their mythology,
or rather what we should call fairy-land.</p>
<p>Near the western extremity of this lake are the Apostle
Islands, which are evidently detachments of a peninsula,
running out in the same direction with Keweenaw, which is
known as La Point. The group consists of three islands,
and they stud the water most charmingly. There is a
dreamy summer beauty about them, which made me almost
sigh to dwell along their peaceful and solitary shores for ever.
They are covered with dense forests, and ascend from the
water&rsquo;s edge to a conspicuous height.</p>
<p>On the extreme point of the largest island is situated a
trading post known as La Point. When I was there, it contained
about a dozen inhabited log cabins, and the wigwams
of about three thousand Chippeway Indians. They were
assembled there to receive their annual instalment in money
and goods from the general government, as a return for the
untold acres, which they had deeded to their &ldquo;Great Father
and Protector,&rdquo; the President. The sum allotted to each was
four dollars in money, and in goods one blanket and a sufficient
amount of cloth to make a pair of leggins. This was
all, and yet many of these poor wretches had paddled their
canoes more than a thousand miles, to obtain this meager
present. The great majority had reached the Point in a state
of starvation, and were therefore immediately compelled to
transfer their money into the open hands of the American
Fur Company, for pork at <i>fifty</i> dollars per barrel and flour
at <i>fifteen</i> dollars per hundred. It was understood, however,
that when the red barbarians should start for their distant
homes, the white barbarians would furnish them with sufficient
provisions to take them out of sight. This unhappy
state of things took such firm hold upon my feelings that my
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
reflections upon the fate of the Indian tribes actually threw
me into a thoughtful mood, and prevented me from enjoying
my visit on the island. There is a Protestant missionary establishment
at this place, but the missionaries are compelled
to prosecute their labors as if with tied hands and closed lips,
on account of the superior power of the Romish church.
From time immemorial La Point has been the Mecca of the
fur traders and the poor Indians. After exploring the immense
wilderness on the west and north, enduring the severest
hardships, they look forward to their visit at this place
as the prominent event of the year. It is also the recruiting
or starting place for all expeditions to the Mississippi river,
there being only two routes,&mdash;that by the Brul&eacute; and Saint
Croix rivers, and another by the Saint Louis.</p>
<p>The rivers running into Lake Superior from the south
are quite numerous, but none of them are very large. They
are all remarkably clear, and abound in waterfalls. They
invariably enter the lake in some sandy bay, and it is a singular
fact, that shortly after a severe storm many of them
cannot be entered even by a canoe, owing to their being
blocked with sand, which event is of course followed by an
overflow, for the time, of the surrounding country. When
the storm has subsided, however, they break through the
sandy barriers, and rush with great velocity into the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault Saint Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>The entire Canadian shore of Lake Superior might be
denominated as bold and rocky, but there may occasionally
be seen a line of the smoothest beach, as if for the very purpose
of affording protection to the voyaging Indians when
exposed to the dangers of sudden storms. The bluffs are
generally of a green sandstone, and frequently rise to the
height of five hundred feet above the water, like massive bulwarks,
which seem to have battled with the elements for
many ages. The mountains which skirt the northern shore
of Superior, form the dividing ridge between the streams
which run into the Lake and those which take a northerly
direction into Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. After passing the first and
most lofty range, the country for about fifty miles is mainly
made up of low granite hills, when it settles into a level
wilderness, extending, as is supposed, to the Arctic Sea, and
where tamarack swamps may be seen in their greatest perfection.
This entire region produces but little for purposes
of agriculture.</p>
<p>The two most prominent peninsulas on this shore are
called Thunder Cape and Carriboo Point. The former is
about fourteen hundred feet high, and frowns upon the waste
of waters, like a crouching lion, which animal it closely
resembles in the form of its outline. When passing near its
base, it looms against the sky in awful grandeur, the seeming
lord and master of the boundless wilderness world around.
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Carriboo Point is less lofty, but far-famed on account of the
hieroglyphics which have been painted upon its brow in
other years, by an Indian race now supposed to be extinct. In
the vicinity of these bluffs, are found the largest and most
beautiful agates in the world.</p>
<p>The Canadian shore of this lake abounds in rocky islands,
but of all those which I visited there is only one deserving
of a particular notice. It lies in the northeastern part of the
lake, and is unquestionably the greatest natural curiosity in
this wilderness,&mdash;not even excepting the Chippeway Falls,
the Saint Louis River, or the Pictured Cliffs on the southern
shore of Superior. I visited it with a party of Indians and
miners, and the former informed us, that we were the first
white men who had ever ventured to explore its interior. It is
found about twenty miles from the main coast, and is supposed
to be about a dozen miles in circumference. The shores are of
sandstone, and for the most part rise abruptly from the water
to the height of four or five hundred feet. But the wonder
is, that in the centre of this island lies embosomed one of the
most beautiful lakes imaginable. It is about a mile long,
and the perpendicular cliffs which look down upon it, are not
far from seven hundred feet in height. It has an outlet,
which is impassable for a canoe, on account of the rocks and
trees that have blocked up the narrow chasm; and at the
opening of this outlet stands a column of solid rock, which
we estimated to be eight hundred feet high. The base is
probably one hundred feet in diameter, and it gradually tapers
off to about twenty feet in thickness, while the summit of
this singular needle is surmounted by one solitary pine tree.
The waters of this inner lake are clear, but have a blackish
appearance, and are very deep. It is so completely hidden
from the surrounding world, that the passing breeze scarcely
ever ruffles its tranquil bosom, and the silence which reigns
there, even at noonday, is intense and almost frightful. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
some places the walls which surrounded the lake appear to
have been recently rent asunder, and partly demolished, as
there were immense piles of broken rocks lying at their base;
while in other places the upper points and edges are overgrown
with moss, and from their brows occasionally depends
a cluster of fantastic vines, drooping perpendicularly to the
tranquil water, which reproduces the beautiful pictures in its
translucent bosom. The lake, so far as we could ascertain,
is destitute of fish, and the island of animals; but when we
were there gulls of every variety, and in immense numbers,
were filling the air with their wild screams. The entire
island seems to be composed of rocky materials, but is every
where covered with a stunted growth of vegetation. I spent
one day rambling over this singular spot, and one night
slumbering by our watch-fire in the shadowy cove at the
mouth of the ravine; and at dawn, on the following morning,
we boarded our feathery canoes and were joyfully
skimming &ldquo;over the deep waters of the dark blue sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the countless Indian legends, which create a kind of
classical interest in the scenery of Lake Superior, the most
singular and universal have reference to a noted personage
whose name was Menaboujou; and as it is a <i>traditionary</i> fact,
that he was, owing to his passion for water, buried in the
liquid centre of the island I have described, it is meet, I
ween, that I should devote a portion of this chapter to a record
of his history. He was the Noah as well as the Jonah of
this portion of the heathen world, and is said to have been
created by Manito for the especial purpose of acting as the
ruler of all men, and guardian of Lake Superior in particular;
while some affirm that he was Manito himself. The
Indians describe him as a being of immense size&mdash;who could
stride across the widest rivers and grasp the lightning in his
hands, and whose voice was like the roar of Superior in a
storm. They also affirm that he excelled in all the arts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
war and of the chase, that the Chippeway nation are his
legitimate descendants, and that he died at the advanced age
of one thousand winters. At the mention of his name in the
Indian lodges, the children hush their prattle, and listen with
wonder to the tales which are sure to follow. It is alleged
that he was gifted with the strange powers of the necromancer,
could transform himself into any animal or inanimate
object in nature, at a moment&rsquo;s warning, and was wont to hold
converse with every living creature at his will. There is
not a headland on Lake Superior, or a river emptying into
it, which is not hallowed in Indian story by his wonderful
exploits. The revolving seasons were at his command. He
covered the earth with snow, and fettered the streams in ice.
At his mandate the mountains were covered with verdure,
and northern flowers bloomed in surpassing beauty. He
commanded, and the terrible storm-winds broke from their
prison caves, and lashed the mighty plain of waters into pure
white foam; and the zephyr, which scarcely caused a leaf to
tremble, or a ripple on the sleeping waves, was also attributed
to his power. In fine, the qualifications of this noted individual
were as numerous as they seem to us incongruous
and heathenish. To the philosopher, however, these glimpses
into the mythology of the aborigines are not without their
value, and this conviction is my only apology for recording
them.</p>
<p>The death of Menaboujou was an important era in the
history of the Chippeway nation. During his life the calamities
of war and intemperance were unknown, but the Evil
One having challenged him to mortal combat, a desperate
battle was fought between the mighty potentates, which resulted
in the triumph of evil, and the extinction of all good,
in the person of its chief author. The battle occurred in the
midst of a thunder-storm and on the summit of Thunder Cape,
the only weapons used being clubs of immense size, made
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
of the pine and spruce; and when the result was known, a
mournful lamentation was heard throughout all the land.
The entire Chippeway nation attended the funeral of the departed,
and when they were bearing his huge corse to the
lake within the nameless island, a rock was seen to rise out
of the water, as a monument planted there by the Great
Spirit, to perpetuate the memory of the beloved Menaboujou.
The rock herein alluded to, rises to the height of about thirty
feet, and bears an astonishing resemblance to a human head.
I took a drawing of this rock, and look upon it as one of my
rarest curiosities.</p>

<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault Saint Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the voyager of the northwest is the
shipping merchant of the wilderness; for his principal business
is to transport furs from the interior county to the frontier
settlements, or merchandise from the settlements into the
interior. By birth he is half French, and half Indian, but in
habits, manners, and education, a full-blooded Indian. Like
the Indian, his home is where he may happen to pitch his
tent. His usual possessions consist of a good supply of bark
canoes, and he ever holds himself in readiness, either to
transport goods, or act as a guide and companion to the traveller
who may require his services. His dress is something
less than half civilized, and his knowledge of the world
equal to that of his savage brethren;&mdash;amiable even to a
fault, but intemperate and without a religion.</p>
<p>It was in a company of some fifty men, composed of
voyagers and Indians, and commanded by Allen Morrison,
that I performed my pilgrimage to the head waters of the
Mississippi, and around the shores of Lake Superior. There
were ten canoes in our <i>fleet</i>; the largest (about forty feet
long) was occupied by Morrison, myself, and five picked
men. He was on his annual visit to the north, to attend the
Indian payments, and the great majority of the Indians
travelled under his flag, partly for the fun of it, but principally
for the purpose of drawing upon him for food, which
he always dealt out to them with a liberal hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Our time of starting was at day-break, and having paddled
three pipes, (about eighteen miles,) we generally landed upon
a pleasant sand-bar, or in some leafy nook, and spent an hour
or more in cooking and eating our breakfast. A &ldquo;pipe,&rdquo; I
should here remark, is what a sporting gentleman might call
a <i>heat</i> of six miles, at the end of which our oarsmen would
rest themselves, while enjoying a smoke of ten minutes. Our
principal food consisted of pork and dough, which were invariably
boiled in a tin kettle. Whenever we happened to have
any game, or fish, this rarity was also placed in the same
kettle with the pork and dough, all of which we disposed of
with the assistance of our fingers and a large knife. As
Mr. Morrison and myself were acknowledged to belong to
the &ldquo;first class&rdquo; of people, we were privileged to use (without
giving offence) a small quantity of tea and maple sugar,
which we had brought with us. Simple as was our food, it
was as wholesome, and at that time as palatable to my taste,
as any that I could have obtained from Delmonico&rsquo;s. I was
in the habit of devouring, and digesting too, long strings of
heavy dough, which would, under ordinary circumstances,
have actually destroyed me. Our meals, however, were
always looked forward to with unalloyed pleasure, and were
considered a luxury to be enjoyed only twice during the day,&mdash;breakfasting,
as we did, at ten, and supping soon after
pitching our tents in the evening. Fifty miles per day, when
there were no portages or rapids to pass, were generally considered
a good run. The two or three hours before bedtime
I generally spent in conversation with Morrison, the
voyagers, or Indians,&mdash;and usually retired with my head as
full of wilderness images, as a bee-hive at swarming time.
The only trouble with my ideas was, that they created a
great excitement, but would not swarm according to my will.
My couch (a part of which was appropriated to Morrison)
consisted of a <i>soft spot of ground</i>, while my gun and pouch
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
answered for a pillow, and my only covering was a large
green blanket. When the weather was clear we did not
pitch our tent, but slept under a tree, or used the star-studded
sky for a canopy. After such a night, I have awakened,
and found my blanket actually white with frozen dew.</p>
<p>The pleasures of this mode of travelling are manifold.
The scenery that you pass through is of the wildest character,
the people you meet with &ldquo;are so queer,&rdquo; and there is
a charm in the very mystery and sense of danger which attend
the windings of a wilderness stream, or the promontories
and bays of a lonely lake. The only <i>apparent</i> miseries which
befall the voyager, are protracted rain storms and musketoes.
On one occasion, while coasting Lake Superior, we were
overtaken by a sudden storm, but succeeded in reaching the
shore (about a mile off) without being swamped. It was
about sundown, and owing to the wind and rain we were unable
to make a fire, and consequently went supperless to
bed. For my part, I looked upon our condition as perfectly
wretched, and cared little what became of me. We had
landed on a fine beach, where we managed to pitch our
tents, and there threw ourselves down for the purpose of
sleeping; and though wet to the skin, I never slept more
sweetly in my life,&mdash;for the roaring of Lake Superior in a
storm is a most glorious lullaby. On the following morning,
I was awakened <i>by the surf washing against my feet</i>.</p>
<p>As to musketoes, had I not taken with me a quantity of
bar netting, I positively believe the creatures would have
eaten me. But with this covering fastened to four sticks, I
could defy the wretches, and I was generally lulled to sleep
by their annoying hum, which sometimes seemed to me like
the howls of infernal spirits.</p>
<p>The only animals which ever had the daring to annoy
us, were a species of gray wolf, which sometimes succeeded
in robbing us of our food. On one occasion, I remember we
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
had a short allowance of pork, and for the purpose of protecting
it with greater care than usual, Mr. Morrison had
placed it in a bag under his head, when he went to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At midnight, in his un-guarded tent,&rdquo; his head was suddenly
thumped against the ground, and by the time he was
fairly awakened, he had the peculiar satisfaction of seeing <i>a
wolf, on the keen run, with the bag of pork</i>.</p>
<p>The more prominent incidents connected with canoe voyaging,
which relieve the monotony of a long voyage, are the
making of portages, the passing of rapids, and the singing of
songs.</p>
<p>Portages are made for the purpose of getting below or
above those falls which could not be passed in any other manner,
also for the purpose of going from one stream to another,
and sometimes they are made to shorten the distance to be
travelled, by crossing points or peninsulas. It was invariably
the habit of our voyagers to run a race, when they came in
sight of a portage, and they did not consider it ended until
their canoes were launched in the water at the farther end
of the portage. The consequence of this singular custom is,
that making a portage is exceedingly exciting business.
Two men will take the largest canoe upon their shoulders,
and cross the portage on a regular trot, stopping, however,
to rest themselves and enjoy a pipe at the end of every
thousand paces. At landing the canoe is not allowed to touch
the bottom, but you must get out into the water and unload
it while yet afloat. The loads of furs or merchandise which
these men sometimes carry are enormous. I have seen a
man convey three hundred and fifty pounds, up a steep hill,
two hundred feet high, and that too without once stopping
to rest; and I <i>heard</i> the story, that there were
three voyagers in the northern wilderness, who have been
known, unitedly, to carry <i>twenty-one hundred pounds</i> over a
portage of eight miles. In making portages it is occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
necessary to traverse tamarack swamps, and the most horrible
one in the northwest lies midway between Sandy Lake
and the Saint Louis River. It is about nine miles in length,
and a thousand fold more difficult to pass than the Slough
of Despond, created by the mind of Bunyan. In crossing it,
you sometimes have to wade in pure mud up to your middle;
and on this route I counted the wrecks of no less than seven
canoes, which had been abandoned by the over-fatigued voyagers;
and I also noticed the grave of an unknown foreigner,
who had died in this horrible place, from the effect of a
poisonous root which he had eaten. Here, in this gloomy
solitude had he breathed his last, with none to cool his feverish
brow but a poor ignorant Indian;&mdash;alone and more than
a thousand leagues from his kindred and home.</p>
<p>But the excitement of passing the rapids of a large river
like the Mississippi, exceeds that of any other operation connected
with voyaging. The strength, dexterity, and courage
required and employed for passing them, are truly astonishing.
I have been in a canoe, and on account of a stone or
floating tree have seen it held for some minutes perfectly
still, when midway up a foaming rapid, merely by two men
with long poles, standing at each end of the canoe. If, at
such a time, one of the poles should slip, or one of the men
make a wrong move, the canoe would be taken by the water
and dashed to pieces either on the surrounding rocks, or the
still more rocky shore. It is, however, much more dangerous
to descend than to ascend a rapid; for it is then almost
impossible to stop a canoe, when under full headway, and if
you happen to strike a rock, you will find your <i>wafery</i> canoe
no better than a sieve. To pass down the falls of Saint
Mary, with an experienced voyager, is one of the most interesting,
yet thrilling and fearful feats that can be performed.
There are rapids and falls, however, which cannot at any
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
time be passed with safety, and my escape from one of these
was as follows:</p>
<p>In making the Grand Portage in the Saint Louis, owing
to the rugged character of the country, it is necessary to land
your canoes only a few yards above a succession of falls
that descend into a pool thirty feet below. Owing to the
thoughtlessness of our pilot, our canoe was suffered to go
nearer than was customary, when Morrison uttered a most
fearful shout, and said that we were within the charmed
circle, and unless we strained every nerve to the utmost, we
must surely perish. By that time we were on the very
verge of the cataract, but we sprang to the paddles with all
our might, and &ldquo;the boldest held his breath.&rdquo; The agony
that we suffered cannot be expressed;&mdash;it lasted, however,
only for a moment; we soon succeeded in reaching the
shore, but our brows were heavily beaded, and we threw ourselves
upon the green-sward, actually trembling with excessive
feebleness. As may be supposed, the remainder of that
day was solemnly spent, for our minds were continually
haunted by the grim visage of death.</p>
<p>One of the more prominent traits of the voyager&rsquo;s character
is his cheerfulness. Gay and mirthful by nature and
habit&mdash;patient and enduring at labor&mdash;seeking neither ease
nor wealth&mdash;and, though fond of his family, it is his custom to
let the morrow take care of itself, while he will endeavor to
improve the present hour as he thinks proper. He belongs
to a race which is entirely distinct from all others on the
globe. It is a singular fact, that when most troubled, or
when enduring the severest hardships, they will joke, laugh,
and sing their uncouth songs&mdash;the majority of which are extemporaneous,
appropriate to the occasion, and generally of
a rude and licentious character. They are invariably sung
in Canadian French, and the following literal translations
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
may be looked upon as favorable specimens, which I first
heard on the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The same canoe in which I explored the upper thousand
miles of the Mississippi, also bore me in safety around the
shores of Lake Superior: first, eastward, along the northern
shore, then back again to Fon du Lac, and afterwards along
the southern shore to the Apostle Islands. Delighted as I
was with my canoe wanderings on the head waters of the
Mighty River, I am constrained to yield the palm to
Superior. For weeks did I explore its picturesque bays and
extended sweeps of shore, following the promptings of my
wayward will, and storing my mind with its unnumbered
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
legends, gathered from the lips of my Indian companions.
I seldom took a paddle in hand, unless it were for exercise,
but usually employed my time, when the weather was calm,
by reading or sketching; and often, when the sunshine made
me sleepy, have been lulled into a dreamy repose, by the
measured music of the oars, mingled with the wild chanting
of the voyagers. It was the custom with my companions,
whenever they caught me in those lucid intervals of joy, to
startle me, by a piercing whoop, which invariably announced
a race upon the watery plain. And then, indeed, was it a
most exciting spectacle to witness the canoes gliding to the
destined goal, almost as swift as &ldquo;an arrow from a shivering
bow.&rdquo; Whenever I expressed such a desire, the party
came to a halt upon the shore, and then it was that I mounted
the headlands to gather berries, or obtain a bird&rsquo;s-eye prospect
of the Lake. At times, the roar of a distant waterfall
would fall upon the ear, and I was wont to beg an hour&rsquo;s
furlough for the purpose of catching a dozen or two of trout
in the waters of a nameless stream. But my chief employment,
whenever we landed, was to gather agates and pebbles
of loveliest hue. In many places the gravelly shores were
completely covered with them; and often, when attracted by
one of a particular color or an unusual size, and when deceived
by the marvellous transparency of the water, have I
found myself far beyond my depth in the sleeping waves,
which event was about the only one that could bring me to
my senses. Many a time and oft, like a very child, have I
rambled along the beach for miles, returning to my canoe
completely loaded down with my treasures, which I sometimes
carried with me on my journey for a hundred miles,
and then threw away to make room for others which I
thought still more beautiful. Delightful, indeed, were those
summer days on the bosom of that lonely lake. They are
associated with my treasured dreams, and I cannot but sigh
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
when I remember that I may never be privileged to enjoy
the like again. My reason would not stop the tide of civilization
which is sweeping to the remote north and the far Pacific,
but if the wishes of my heart were realized, none but
the true worshippers of nature should ever be permitted to
mar the solitude of the wilderness with the song of Mammon.</p>
<p>But, if that were possible, the nights that I spent upon
the shores of the great northern lake have made a deeper
impression on my heart than those summer days. Never
before had the ocean of the sky and the starry world appeared
so supremely brilliant. Seldom would my restless
spirit allow me an unbroken slumber from nightfall until
dawn, and I was often in a wakeful mood, even after the
camp fires were entirely out, and my rude companions were
in the embrace of slumber. One of those wonderful nights
I never can forget. I had risen from my couch upon the
sand, and after walking nearly half a mile along the beach,
I passed a certain point, and found myself in full view of
the following scene, of which I was the solitary spectator.
Black, and death-like in its repose, was the apparently
illimitable plain of water; above its outline, on the left, were
the strangely beautiful northern lights, shooting their rays to
the very zenith; on the right was a clear full moon, making
a silvery pathway from my feet to the horizon; and before,
around, and above me, floating in the deep cerulean, were
the unnumbered and mysterious stars&mdash;the jewels of the
Most High. The only sound that fell upon my ear was the
occasional splash of a tiny wave, as it melted upon the shore.
Long and intently did I gaze upon the scene, until, in a kind
of blissful frenzy, or bewilderment, I staggered a few paces,
fell upon the earth, almost insensible, and was soon in a deep
sleep. The first gleam of sunshine roused me from slumber,
and I returned to our encampment perfectly well in body,
but in a thoughtful and unhappy mood. In fact, it seemed
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
to me that I had visited the spiritual world, and I wished to
return hence once more. My friends had not wondered at
my absence, when they awoke, for they supposed that I had
gone merely to take my accustomed bath. But enough,
enough. The voyager&rsquo;s life is indeed a romantic one, but
it will not do for me to talk about it for ever, and I therefore
bring my description to a close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault Saint Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>I am the owner of a few shares of copper stock, but exceedingly
anxious to dispose of my interest, at the earliest
possible moment, and on the most reasonable terms. This
remark defines my position with regard to copper in general,
and may be looked upon as the text from which I shall proceed
to make a few, a very few, general observations on the
copper region of Lake Superior. I am curious to find out
how it will seem, for the public at large to read something
which is not a purchased puff. Those, therefore, who are
unaccustomed to simple matters of fact, will please pass on
to another chapter of my little book, or lay it down as the
most insipid volume that was ever published.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly true, that all the hills and mountains
surrounding this immense lake, abound in valuable minerals,
of which the copper, in every variety of form, is the most
abundant. The lamented Douglas Houghton has published
the opinion, that this region contains the most extensive copper
mines in the known world. The discoveries which
have been made during the last three years would lead one
to suppose this opinion to be founded in truth.</p>
<p>Not to mention the ship loads of rich ore that I have
seen at different times, I would, merely to give my reader
an idea of what is doing here, give the weight of a few distinguished
discoveries that I have actually seen.</p>
<p>The native copper boulder, discovered by the traveller
Henry, in the bed of the Ontonagon river, and now in Washington,
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
originally weighed thirty-eight hundred pounds; a
copper mass of the same material was lately found near
Copper Harbor, weighing twelve hundred pounds; at Copper
Falls the miners are now at work upon a vein of solid
ore, which already measures twenty feet in length, nine in
depth, and seven and a half inches in thickness, which must
weigh a number of tons; and at Eagle River another boulder
has lately been brought to light, weighing seventeen
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>As to native silver, the Eagle River valley has yielded
the largest specimen yet found about this lake, the weight
of which was six pounds and ten ounces. These are mineral
statistics from which may be drawn as great a variety of
conclusions as there are minds.</p>
<p>The number of mining companies which purport to be
in operation on the American shore of Lake Superior and
on our islands, is said to be one hundred; and the number
of stock shares is not far from three hundred thousand. But
notwithstanding all the fuss that has been, and is still made,
about the mining operations here, a smelting furnace has
not yet been erected, and only three companies, up to the
present time, have made any shipments of ore. The oldest
of these is the Lake Superior Company; the most successful,
the Pittsburg and Boston Company; and the other is
the Copper Falls Company, all of which are confined in
their operations to Point Keweenaw.</p>
<p>This point is at present the centre of attraction to those
who are worshipping the copper Mammon of the age. It is
a mountainous district, covered with a comparatively useless
pine forest, exceedingly rocky and not distinguished for
its beautiful scenery. As to the great majority of the mining
companies alluded to, they will undoubtedly sink a good
deal more money than they can possibly make; and for the
reason, that they are not possessed of sufficient capital to
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
carry on the mining business properly, and are managed by
inexperienced and visionary men&mdash;a goodly number of
whom have failed in every business in which they ever
figured, and who are generally adventurers, determined to
live by speculation instead of honest labor. The two principal
log cabin cities of Point Keweenaw are Copper Harbor
and Eagle River. The former is quite a good harbor, and
supports a vacated garrison, a newspaper, a very good boarding-house,
and several intemperance establishments. The
latter has a fine beach for a harbor, a boarding-house, a saw-mill,
and a store, where drinking is the principal business
transacted. The number of resident inhabitants in the two
towns I was unable to learn, but the sum total I suppose
would amount to fifty souls.</p>
<p>Altogether perhaps five hundred miners and clerks may
be engaged on the whole Point, while about as many more,
during the summer, are hanging about the general stopping
places on the shore, or the working places in the interior.
This brotherhood is principally composed of upstart geologists,
explorers, and location speculators. From all that I
can learn, about the same state of things exists on the
Canada side of the lake. Twenty companies are already
organized for that section of country, the most promising of
which is the Montreal Mining Company; but not a pound
of ore has yet been smelted or taken to market, so that the
&ldquo;subject theme,&rdquo; for the present, is as barren of real interest
there, as in our own territory. Rationally speaking,
the conclusion of the whole matter is just this: the Lake
Superior region undoubtedly abounds in valuable minerals,
but as yet a sufficient length of time has not elapsed to
develop its resources; three quarters of the people (the remaining
quarter are among the most worthy of the land)
now engaged in mining operations, are what might be termed
dishonest speculators and inexperienced adventurers: but
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
there is no doubt that if a new order of things should be
brought into existence here, all those who are prudent and
industrious would accumulate fortunes.</p>
<p>I ought not to leave this brazen theme, without alluding
to the science of geology as patronized in the mineral region.
Not only does the nabob stockholder write pamphlets about
the mines of the <i>Ural</i> mountains, and other <i>neighboring</i> regions,
but even the broken down New-York merchant, who
now sells whisky to the poor miner, strokes his huge whiskers
and descants upon the black oxyd, the native ore, and
the peculiar formation of every hillside in the country.
Without exception, I believe, all the men, women and children
residing in the copper cities, have been crystalized
into finished geologists. It matters not how limited their
knowledge of the English language may be, for they look
only to the surface of things; it matters not how empty of
common sense their brain-chambers may be, they are
wholly absorbed in sheeting their minds and hearts with the
bright red copper, and are all loudly eloquent on their favorite
theme.</p>
<p>But the grand lever which they use to advance their interests,
is the word &ldquo;conglomerate,&rdquo; which answers as a
general description of the surrounding country. You stand
upon a commanding hill-top, and while lost in the enjoyment
of a fine landscape, a Copper Harbor &ldquo;bear&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bull,&rdquo; recently from Wall-street, will slap you on the
shoulder and startle the surrounding air with the following
yell: &ldquo;That whole region, sir, is <i>conglomerate</i>, and exceedingly
rich in copper and silver.&rdquo; You ask your landlady
for a drop of milk to flavor your coffee, and she will tell you
&ldquo;that her husband has exchanged the old red cow for a conglomerate
location somewhere in the interior,&rdquo; thereby proving
that a comfortable living is a secondary consideration
in this life. You happen to see a little girl arranging some
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
rocky specimens in her baby-house, and on your asking her
name, she will probably answer&mdash;&ldquo;Conglomerate the man!
my name, sir, is Jane.&rdquo; But enough. It will not do for
me to continue in this strain, for fear that my readers will,
like my mining friends, be made crazy by a remarkable
conglomerate literary specimen from the mineral region.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Sault Saint Marie</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>One more letter from this place, and I shall take my
leave of Lake Superior. Saint Mary was formerly a trading
post of renown: it is now a village of considerable business;
and as the resources of the mineral region are developed,
will undoubtedly become a town of importance in a commercial
point of view; and the contemplated ship canal through
this place (which would allow a boat from Buffalo to discharge
her freight or passengers at Fon Du Lac) ought not
to be delayed a single year. There is a garrison at this
point; the society is good, bad, and indifferent, and in the
summer season it is one of the busiest little places in the
country. But I intend this to be a piscatorial letter, and
must therefore change my tune.</p>
<p>The river Saint Mary, opposite this village, is about two
miles wide, and having found its way out of a deep bay of
the ocean lake, it here rushes over a ledge of rocks in great
fury, and presents, for the distance of nearly a mile, a perfect
sheet of foam, and this spot is called the Sault, signifying
falls. The entire height of the fall is about thirty feet,
and after the waters have expressed in a murmuring roar,
their unwillingness to leave the bosom of Superior, they
finally hush themselves to sleep, and glide onward, as if in a
dream, along the picturesque shores of a lonely country,
until they mingle with the waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<p>The principal fish of this region are trout and white-fish,
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
which are among the finest varieties in the world, and are
here found in their greatest perfection. Of the trout, the
largest species in Lake Superior is called the lake trout, and
they vary from ten to sixty pounds in weight. Their flesh
is precisely similar to that of the salmon in appearance, and
they are full as delicious as an article of food. The Indians
take them in immense quantities with the gill-net during the
spring and summer, where the water is one hundred feet
deep; but in the autumn, when the fish hover about the
shores for the purpose of spawning, the Indians catch them
with the spear by torch-light. They also have a mode of
taking them in the winter through the ice. After reaching
the fishing ground, they cut a hole in the ice, over which
they erect a kind of wigwam, and in which they seat themselves
for action. They attach a piece of meat to a cord as
bait, which they lower and pull up for the purpose of attracting
the trout, thereby alluring the unsuspecting creature to
the top of the hole, when they pick it out with a spear. An
Indian has been known to catch a thousand weight in one
day, in this novel manner. But as the ice on Lake Superior
is seldom suffered to become very thick on account of the
frequent storms, it is often that these solitary fishermen are
borne away from the shore and perish in the bosom of the
deep.</p>
<p>My mode of fishing for lake trout, however, was with
the hook. In coasting along the lake in my canoe I sometimes
threw out about two hundred feet of line, to which
was attached a stout hook and a piece of pork, and I seldom
tried this experiment for an hour without capturing a fifteen
or twenty pounder. At other times, when the lake was still,
and I was in the mood, I have paddled to where the water
was fifty feet in depth, and with a drop-line have taken, in
twenty minutes, more trout than I could eat in a fortnight,
which I generally distributed among my Indian companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>A fish called ciscovet, is unquestionably of the trout
genus, but much more delicious and seldom found to weigh
more than a dozen pounds. They are a very beautiful fish,
and at the present time are decidedly the fattest I have
ever seen. Their habits are similar to those of the trout,
and they are taken in the same manner.</p>
<p>But <i>the</i> fish of this region, and of the world, is the common
trout. The five rivers which empty into Lake Superior
on the north, and the thirty streams which run from the south,
all abound in this superb fish, which vary from ten to forty
ounces in weight. But the finest place for this universal
favorite, in the known world, is, without any doubt, the Falls
of Saint Mary. At this place they are in season throughout
the year, from which circumstance I am inclined to believe
that there must be several varieties, which closely resemble
each other. At one time you may fish all day and not capture
a single specimen that will weigh over a pound, and at
another time you may take a boat-load of them which will
average from three to four pounds in weight. You may
accuse me of telling a large story when I speak of boat-loads
of <i>trout</i>, but I do assure you that such sights are of frequent
occurrence at the Sault. My favorite mode of trouting at
this place has been to enter a canoe and cast anchor at the
foot of the rapids, where the water was ten or fifteen feet
deep, but owing to its marvellous clearness appeared to be
about three, and where the bed of the river or strait is completely
covered with snow-white rocks. I usually fished
with a fly or artificial minnow, and was never disappointed
in catching a fine assortment whenever I went out. My
favorite spot was about midway between the American and
Canadian shores, and there have I spent whole days enjoying
the rarest of sport; now looking with wonder at the wall of
foam between me and the mighty lake; now gazing upon
the dreamy-looking scenery on either side and far below me;
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
and anon peering into the clear water to watch the movements
of the trout as they darted from the shady side of one
rock to another, or leaped completely out of their native element
to seize the hovering fly. During all this time my
spirit would be lulled into a delightful peacefulness, by the
solemn roar of the Sault. I have taken trout in more than
one half of the United States, but have never seen a spot
where they were so abundant as in this region, but I must
acknowledge that there are streams in New England and
New-York where I have thrown the fly with more intellectual
enjoyment than in the river Saint Mary.</p>
<p>But I must devote a paragraph to the white-fish of Lake
Superior. They are of the shad genus, and with regard to
flavor are second only to their salt water brethren. They
are taken at all seasons of the year with gill-nets and the
seine in the deep waters of the lake; at this point, however,
the Indians catch them with a scoop-net, and in the following
manner. Two Indians jump into a canoe above the rapids,
and while one navigates it among the rocks and through the
foaming waters, the other stands on the look-out, and with
the speed of lightning picks out the innocent creatures while
working their way up the stream unconscious of all danger.
This is a mode of fishing which requires great courage,
immense strength, and a steady nerve. A very slight mistake
on the part of the steersman, or a false movement of the
net-man, will cause the canoe to be swamped, when the
inmates have to struggle with the foam awhile until they
reach the still water, when they strike for the shore, there
to be laughed at by their rude brethren of the wilderness,
while the passing stranger will wonder that any men should
attempt such dangerous sport. But accidents of this kind
seldom happen, and when they do the Indians anticipate no
danger, from the fact that they are all such expert swimmers.
It took me three days to muster sufficient courage to go
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
down these rapids in a canoe with an Indian, and though I
performed the feat without being harmed, I was so prodigiously
frightened that I did not capture a single fish, though
I must have seen, within my reach, upwards of a thousand.
The white-fish, ciscovet, and lake trout have already become
an article of export from this region, and I believe the time
is not far distant, when the fisheries of Lake Superior will
be considered as among the most lucrative in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Mackinaw</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>I now write from Mackinaw, the beautiful, which
studs the waters of the north, as does the northern star its
own cerulean home. But what can I say about this island
that will be new, since &ldquo;every body&rdquo; now pays it a brief
visit while journeying in the West? It is indeed one of the
most unique and delightful places in the world. Its shores
are laved by the waters of Superior, Michigan, and Huron,
and rising abruptly as its does to a conspicuous height, it
seems as if planted there by nature as a fortress, for the express
purpose of protecting the lakes from which it sprung.
I first approached it from the north, on a mild and hazy afternoon,
and as it loomed before me, enveloped in a purple atmosphere,
I looked upon it in perfect silence, fearing that
even the beating of my heart would dispel what I thought to
be a mere illusion. As our vessel approached, however, it
gradually changed into a dreamy reality, and I could distinguish
its prominent characteristics. First, was a perpendicular
bluff, crowned with a diadem of foliage, at the foot
of which was an extensive beach, occupied by an Indian encampment,
where the rude barbarians were sunning themselves
like turtles, playing fantastic games, repairing their
canoes, making mats, or cooking their evening meal, as fancy
or necessity impelled. One sudden turn, and our vessel was
gliding gently into a crescent bay, which was skirted with a
cluster of trading houses and ancient looking dwellings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
above which, on a bluff, was a snow-white fortress, with soldiers
marching to and fro upon the battlements.</p>
<p>The circumference of this island is about nine miles, and
its shores are bold and rocky. The scenery is romantic in
the extreme, and it has four natural curiosities, either one of
which would give a reputation to any ordinary island.
Arched Rock faces the north, and rises from the water to the
height of nearly two hundred feet, presenting from your canoe
a superb piece of wave-formed architecture; and appearing,
as you look through it from the summit, like the
gateway to a new world. Robinson&rsquo;s Folly is also on the
north shore, and is a picturesque bluff, which obtained its
name after the following manner. Many years ago an Englishman,
named Robinson, spent a summer on the island, and
while here, erected for his own especial benefit, a summer-house
on the summit of the bluff in question. He was laughed
at for his pains, and was warned by the cautious traders
and Indians not to spend too much of his time on the cliff,
and especially not to visit it when the wind was blowing.
He scorned the advice which was given him in kindness,
and to show his independence, he frequently spent the night
in his eyrie. On one occasion, however, in the darkness
of midnight, a thunder-storm passed over the island, and at
sunrise on the following morning, the &ldquo;cabin of the cliff&rdquo; and
its unfortunate inmate were buried in the deep. Hence the
name of Robinson&rsquo;s Folly. Another interesting spot on this
island is called the Cave of Skulls. It lies on the western
shore, and is mainly distinguished for its historical associations.
More than a hundred years ago, according to one tradition,
a party of Sioux Indians, while pursued by the Ottowas,
secreted themselves in this cave; and when they were
discovered, which happened soon to be the case, the Ottowas
built a fire before the entrance to the cave, which they kept
up for several days, and when they finally entered the gloomy
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
chamber, their enemies were all dead. The truth of this
story is corroborated by an incident recorded by Henry.
After the massacre of Michilimackinack, this traveller, whose
life had been threatened, was secreted in this cave by a
friendly Indian. He was shown into it in the evening,
scrambled over what he thought a very singular floor, slept
soundly during the night, and on awaking in the morning,
found himself reclining on a bed of human bones. Another
Mackinaw curiosity is called the Needle, and is a lighthouse-looking
rock, which overlooks the entire island, and
throws its shadow upon the ruins of Fort Holmes, which are
now almost level with the ground, and overgrown with
weeds.</p>
<p>During my stay at Mackinaw the weather continued extremely
pleasant, and as I fancied myself midway between
the wilderness and the crowded city,&mdash;escaped from the
dangers of one, and not yet entered upon the troubles of the
latter,&mdash;I threw away all care, and wandered hither and
thither, the victim of an idle will. At one time I took my
sketch-book for the purpose of portraying some interesting
point upon the island, and if a party of ladies happened to
discover me in my shady haunt, I answered their smiles with
a remark, and the interview generally terminated in my presenting
each one of them with a sketch, when they would
pass on, and I would dive deeper into the green woodland.
At another time I sought the brow of some overhanging cliff,
and gazed into the translucent waters, now letting my fancy
revel among the snow-white caverns far below, and now watching
the cautious movements of a solitary lake-trout, as he left
the deeper waters for an exploring expedition in the vicinity
of the shore. But I never witnessed such a sight without
being affected, somewhat like the war-horse when listening
to the trumpet&rsquo;s bray, and in an hour afterwards, I was usually
in a boat, about a mile from shore, trying my luck with
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
an artificial minnow and fifty yards of line. Now, I strolled
along the beach where the Indians were encamped, and after
gathering a lot of romantic legends from the old men, or after
spending an hour talking with some of the virgin squaws,
while making their beautiful matting, I would coax a lot
of Indian boys to accompany me, when we enjoyed a
swim, mostly for our mutual recreation, and partly for my
own instruction in the manly art, which with the red man
is a part of his nature. Sometimes I strolled into the Fort to
converse with the commanding officers, or wasted a little
powder in firing at a target with the soldiers.</p>
<p>Mackinaw, during the season of navigation, is one of the
busiest little places in the world. All the Detroit and Chicago
steamers stop here in passing to and fro, and usually
tarry a sufficient length of time to let their passengers take
a hasty ride over the island, and to replenish their larders
with trout and white-fish, which are commonly taken on
board in cart-loads. From time immemorial the Indians
have been annually summoned to this island, for the purpose
of receiving their regular instalments from the Government,
in the shape of merchandise and money, and on these occasions
it is not uncommon to see an assembly of three thousand
fantastically dressed savages. But in the winter this place
is entirely ice-bound, and of course completely isolated.
Then it is that the inhabitants are favored with a monthly
mail, which is brought from Saginaw by Indians or Half-Breeds,
on sledges drawn by dogs; and fishing, skating, and
story-telling are about the only things which tend to relieve
the monotony of a winter spent upon the island.</p>
<p>Like too many of the beautiful places on our western
frontier, Mackinaw is now in a transition state. Heretofore
it has been the Indian&rsquo;s congregating place, but its aboriginal
glory is rapidly departing, and it will soon be the fashionable
resort of summer travellers. Its peculiar location, picturesque
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
scenery, and the tonic character of its climate, are destined
to make it one of the most attractive watering places in the
country. But enough. One of the Chicago steamers is in
sight, and I must prepare my luggage, previous to taking
passage for the home of my childhood, in Southern Michigan,
where I shall remain a few days, and then hasten to my city
home on the Atlantic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></h2>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">On the River Raisin</span>, August, 1846.</span></p>
<p>Michisawgyegan is the Indian name for the state of
Michigan, and the meaning of it is the Lake Country. It is
my native state, and as I have recently visited it after an
absence of more than a dozen years, and as it is not yet entirely
redeemed from its original state of nature, it is meet, I
ween, that I should, while within its borders, wind up my
echoes of the wilderness. This is the country where I spent
the morning of my days;&mdash;the theatre where my future
character in the drama of life was formed and first acted out.
Remote from the glitter and noise of the great human world,
I used to wander alone through its dark forests, and bathe in
its pure streams, without a care or thought to mar the peacefulness
of life. A thousand words, now full of meaning,
and familiar to my ear, were then but unmeaning sounds.
Those were the days when I sported on the lap of nature,
feeling it to be a luxury to breathe. Will they ever return?
Ask that evening breeze whether it will ever again cool the
fevered brow of that dying man? But very dear to me are
my recollections of Michigan, and I would not part with
them for the treasures of the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>The character of its scenery and people is as original as
its situation. Almost surrounded by water, it possesses all
the advantages of an island, while at the same time it is but
a small portion of a vast whole. Its streams are numerous
and clear, but generally sluggish. A portion of the extreme
north is uninhabited by human beings, owing to its barrenness.
Huge granite mountains here loom upward in eternal
solitude; sometimes presenting the appearance of having
been severed asunder, and scattered around by some mighty
convulsion of nature. On the borders of the cold and desolate
lakes thus formed, the crane and bittern rear their
young. Occasionally, on the brow of some jutting crag,
may be discovered the meager hut of some poor Indian.
Perhaps a barbarous anchorite, to whom the voice of his fellow
man is a grating sound, and to whom existence is but a
mist, a dream; or it may be some disgraced warrior, who has
been banished from friends and home, to dwell in this dreary
solitude, with no companions but a half-starved dog, rugged
pines, and frowning rocks. But this section is said to contain
the richest copper mine in the known world.</p>
<p>The surface of the western half is destitute of rocks,
and undulating; and it is here that the loveliest of lakes
and streams and prairies are to be found. Lake Michigan,
the second in the world, is its western boundary. The eastern
portion is entirely original in its appearance, possessing
many beauties peculiarly its own. It is so level and low that
a stranger approaching it from Lake Erie is often surprised
to find himself in port, while in the act of looking out for
land. This shore is watered by the Huron, St. Clair, and
Erie.</p>
<p>No one, who has never witnessed them, can form any
idea of the exquisite beauty of the thousand lakes which
gem the western part of Michigan. They are the brightest
and purest mirrors the virgin sky has ever used to adorn herself.
Their banks are frequently dotted by human dwellings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
the humble though comfortable abodes of a sturdy yeomanry.
That one which takes its name from an Indian called Baubeese,
and which is the outlet of the St. Joseph river, I will
match against any other of its size in the world.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding what has been so often said by the artificial
inhabitants of cities, concerning the hardships and ignorance
of the backwoodsman&rsquo;s life, there is many a stout
heart, exalted mind, and noble soul, whose dwelling-place
has been for years on the borders of these very lakes. I
know this to be true, for I have slept beneath their roofs, and
often partaken of their johnny-cake and fat quails. No,&mdash;no.
I love these men as brothers, and shall always frown
upon that cit or dandy who sets down aught against them,&mdash;in
malice or in ignorance.</p>
<p>Some of these little lakes smile in perpetual solitude.
One of them is before me now. It is summer. The sun is
above its centre. Deep and dark and still are the shadows
of the surrounding trees and bushes. On the broad leaf of
a water-lily a green snake is curled up, with his head elevated,
and his tongue gleaming in the sunlight. He is the
enemy of all flying insects and little birds, and if you watch
him a little longer you will see one of them decoyed to death
by the power of his charm. Hush! there is a stir among
the dry leaves. It is but a lonely doe coming to quench her
thirst. Is she not the Queen of Beauty? There she stands,
knee-deep in the water, looking downwards, admiring the
brightness of her eyes and the gracefulness of her neck.
How Leigh Hunt would enjoy a ramble here! His favorite
flowers,&mdash;the rose, the violet, the lily, and the sweet-brier,
would each sing him a song more sweet and delicate than
their first. What bright hue is that in the middle of the
lake? It is but the reflection of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;a vapor in the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">Thin, white, and very high.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>A great proportion of Michigan is covered with white-oak
openings. Standing on a gentle hill, the eye wanders
away for miles over an undulating surface, obstructed only
by the trunks of lofty trees,&mdash;above you a green canopy, and
beneath, a carpet of velvet grass, sprinkled with flowers of
every hue and form.</p>
<p>The prairies are another interesting feature of Michigan
scenery. They meet the traveller at every point, and of
many sizes, seeming often like so many lakes, being often
studded with wooded islands, and surrounded by shores of
forests. Their soil is a deep black sand. Grass is their
natural production, although corn, oats, and potatoes flourish
upon them. Never can I forget the first time I entered
White Pigeon Prairie. Sleeping beneath the shadows of
sunset, as it was, the effect upon me was like that which is
felt on first beholding the ocean,&mdash;overpowering awe. All
that the poet has said about these gardens of the desert, is true.</p>
<p>Burr Oak Plains. The only difference between these
and the oak openings, is the character of the trees and the
evenness of their surface. The soil is a mixture of sand
and black loam. They have the appearance of cultivated
orchards, or English parks; and, on places where the foot
of the white man has never trod, a carriage and four could
easily pass through. They produce both wheat and corn.</p>
<p>The wet prairies have the appearance of submerged
land. In them the grass is often six or seven feet high.
They are the resort of water-fowl, muskrats, and otter.</p>
<p>But the best and most fertile soil in Michigan is that designated
by the title of timbered land. It costs more to prepare
it for the plough, but when once the soil is sown it yields a
thousand-fold. And with regard to their beauty and magnificence,
the innumerable forests of this state are not surpassed
by any in the world, whether we consider the variety or
grandeur of their productions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>A friend of mine, now residing in western Michigan, and
who once spent several years in Europe, thus writes respecting
this region:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, such trees as we have here! Magnificent, tall,
large-leafed, umbrageous. Vallombrosa, the far-famed Vallombrosa
of Tuscany, is nothing to the thousand Vallombrosas
here! A fig for your Italian scenery! This is the country
where nature reigns in her virgin beauty; where trees grow,
where corn grows; where men grow better than they do
any where else in the world. This is the land to study nature
in all her luxuriant charms, under glorious green
branches, among singing birds and laughing streams; this
is the land to hear the cooing of the turtle-dove, in far, deep,
cool, sylvan bowers; to feel your soul expand under the
mighty influences of nature in her primitive beauty and
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal inland rivers of Michigan are, the Grand
River, the Kalamazoo, the St. Joseph, the Saginaw, and the
Raisin. The first three empty into Lake Michigan, and are
about seventy miles apart. Their average length is about
two hundred and fifty miles, and they are about thirty or
forty rods in width. At present, they are navigable about
half their length for small steamboats and bateaux. Their
bed is of limestone, covered with pebbles. I was a passenger
on board the Matilda Barney, on her first trip,&mdash;the first
steamer that ever ascended the St. Joseph, which I consider
the most perfectly beautiful stream that I ever have seen. I
remember well the many flocks of wild turkies and herds of
deer, that the &ldquo;iron horse&rdquo; frightened in his winding career.
The Indian canoe is now giving way to the more costly but
less beautiful row-boat, and those rivers are becoming deeper
and deeper every day. Instead of the howl of the wolf, the
songs of husbandmen now echo through their vales, where
may be found many comfortable dwellings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The Saginaw runs toward the north and empties into Lake
Huron,&mdash;that same Huron which has been celebrated in
song by the young poet, Louis L. Noble. This river is
navigable for sixty miles. The river Raisin is a winding
stream, emptying into Lake Erie, called so from the quantity
of grapes that cluster on its banks. Its Indian name is
Numma-sepee, signifying River of Sturgeons. Sweet river!
whose murmurs have so often been my lullaby, mayest thou
continue in thy beauty for ever. Are there not streams like
thee flowing through the paradise of God?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the comparative newness of Michigan,
its general aspect is ancient. The ruin of many an old fort
may be discovered on its borders, reminding the beholder of
wrong and outrage, blood and strife. This was once the
home of noble but oppressed nations. Here lived and loved
the Algonquin and Shawnese Indians; the names of whose
warrior chiefs,&mdash;Pontiac the proud, and Tecumseh the brave,&mdash;will
long be treasured in history. I have stood upon their
graves, which are marked only by a blighted tree and an
unhewn stone, and have sighed deeply as I remembered their
deeds. But they have gone,&mdash;gone like the lightning of a
summer day!</p>
<p>It is a traditionary land. For we are told that the Indian
hunters of old saw fairies and genii floating over its lakes
and streams, and dancing through its lonely forests. In these
did they believe, and to please them was their religion.</p>
<p>The historian<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
of this state thus writes, in alluding to the
olden times: &ldquo;The streams rolled their liquid silver to the
lake, broken only by the fish that flashed in their current, or
the swan that floated upon their surface. Vegetation flourished
alone. Roses bloomed and died, only to be trampled
by the deer or savage; and strawberries studded the ground
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
like rubies, where the green and sunny hillsides reposed
amid the silence, like sleeping infants in the lap of the forest.
The rattlesnake glided undisturbed through its prairies; and
the fog which hung in clouds over its stagnant marshes
spread no pestilence. The panther, the fox, the deer, the
wolf, and bear, roamed fearless through the more remote
parts of the domain, for there were none to dispute with
them their inheritance. But clouds thickened. In the darkness
of midnight, and silence of the wilderness, the tomahawk
and scalping knife were forged for their work of
death. Speeches were made by the savages under the
voiceless stars, which were heard by none save God and
their allies; and the war-song echoed from the banks of
lakes where had never been heard the footsteps of civilized
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed the horrors of war; then and there were
enacted the triumphs of revenge. But those sounds have
died away; traced only on the page of history, those deeds.
The voice of rural labor, the clink of the hammer, and the
sound of Sabbath-bells now echo in those forests and vales.
The plough is making deep furrows in its soil, and the sound
of the anvil is in every part. A well-endowed University,
and seminaries of learning are there. Railroads and canals,
like veins of health, are gliding to its noble heart. The red
man, in his original grandeur and state of nature, has passed
away from its more fertile borders; and his bitterest enemy,
the pale face, is master of his possessions.</p>
<p>The French were the first who settled in Michigan, and
at as early a date as 1620, and for many years, they and
the Indians, were the sole inhabitants. Here it was that the
far famed Jesuit missionaries first pitched their tents in
(what is now) the United States. Now, people out of every
civilized nation dwell within its borders. Detroit, on the
superb river of that name, and Frenchtown, on the river
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
Raisin, were both founded by the French. The former of
these is a city, a flourishing city, of fifteen thousand inhabitants,
where are to be found all the elegances and luxury of
the most polite society. Its principal street would be an
ornament in any city; its elevation is some fifty feet above
the water, and from its docks, the eye wanders over a scene
not unlike that visible from the North River side of the
Empire city. Like most cities, it appears to the best advantage
in winter. Then it is that you may often witness the
beautiful Detroit River frozen like marble, and on its surface
hundreds of sleighs and skaters gliding in every direction;
while a chorus of bells comes faintly and sweetly to your
ear. Monroe, is the modern name for Frenchtown. It is
situated about two miles from Lake Erie, and is also a
flourishing town, containing some four thousand inhabitants,
a goodly portion of whom are the descendants of the early
settlers. Detroit and Monroe, are two of the best wheat
markets in the western country. Ann-Arbor on the Huron
is the New Haven of Michigan, and possesses many attractions
in the way of intelligent people, picturesque scenery,
and handsome buildings. Niles, on the St. Joseph, is a most
difficult place to pass <i>through</i>, for the traveller always feels
an irresistible impulse to remain there for ever,&mdash;it is so
charmingly situated, on such a charming stream, and inhabited
by such charming people. But I might sing this
song under the head of Kalamazoo, Ypsilanti, Tecumseh,
Adrian, Pontiac, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Battle Creek, and
twenty other thriving villages, which are all surrounded
by a fine agricultural country. I cannot now dwell upon
such themes. Numma-sepee is ringing in my ear, and my
thoughts are with my body, on the river, and in the village,
where I was born. Here, I am, after an absence of many
years, a visitor, and to half the people a stranger, on the
very soil where I spent my wild and happy boyhood. I will
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
not touch upon the improvements that meet me at every turn,
nor upon the troops of friends that surround me; my heart
is with the village of other days, not with the business city
of the present time; and as to my friends, I thank them for
their kindness, but they are not of my kindred; they are
changed, and I can only look upon them as strangers.
Reader, as you love to remember the sunny days of your own
life, I invite you to listen to my words, as I attempt to summon
from the past an array of my most dearly cherished
recollections.</p>
<p>Judging from the many accounts I have heard, the spot
now occupied by Monroe must have been, before the last
war, one of the most delightful nooks in the wide world.
Its original name, as before stated, was Frenchtown, and its
only inhabitants were French, who had emigrated thither
from France by the way of Canada. The families did not
number more than about fifty, and the names of the most
conspicuous were Navarre, Duval, Beaubien, Bourdeaux,
Couture, Nadeau, Bannac, Cicot, Campau, Jobien, Godfroy,
Lasselle, Corsenau, Labadee, Durocher, Robert, Lacroix,
Dausette, Loranger, Sancomb, and Fourniet. They inhabited
what might be called an oasis in the wilderness. Their
farms all lay directly upon either side of the river, and
though principally devoted to agricultural pursuits, they
were content with but a few acres of cleared land, and beyond
these, on either hand, stood the mighty forests in their
original solitude and luxuriance. Along their doors glided
the ever-murmuring Raisin, whose fountain-head was then
among the things unknown, and its waters mingled with
those of Erie, without being disturbed by the keel of any
steamboat or white-winged vessel. Comfort and beauty
characterized their dwellings, and around them grew in
great abundance domestic trees, that yielded the most delicious
fruits. In their midst stood a little chapel, overgrown
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
with ivy and surmounted by a cross, where the Jesuit missionaries
or Catholic priests performed their religious duties.
The soft-toned bell that summoned them to worship, was not
without its echoes, but they dwelt far away upon the sleeping
lake or in the bosom of the surrounding wilderness.
Here the tumult of the great human world was never heard,
and money and fame were not the chief desire of the secluded
husbandman, for he was at ease in his possessions.
Indians, the smoke of whose wigwams ascended to heaven
on every side, were the only people with whom the early
settlers had intercourse; from them they obtained valuable
furs, by barter, which they sent to Montreal, receiving in
exchange the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life.
They maintained the habits which were brought from the
provinces whence they emigrated. The gentleman preserved
the garb of the age of Louis XIV., while the peasant
wore a long surtout, sash, red cap, and deer-skin moccasons.
Their knowledge of agriculture was very limited, and the
policy of the fur trade was calculated to keep down the
spirit of improvement in that respect. Of corn and wheat
they were anxious only to raise enough to last them during
the year. A surplus of any thing but furs they did not
desire, and never possessed. Their grain was ground in
windmills, whose picturesque features added to the poetry
of their scenery. Their amusements were confined to the
sound of the violin, at their unaffected assemblies.</p>
<p>The forest afforded them an abundance of game, which
constantly led them to the hunt, and their beautiful stream
abounded in fish, which they captured with the net, the hook,
and the spear. A dreamy summer atmosphere seems to rest
upon this region, when viewed in the light of the olden times.
There was poetry in every thing which met the eye: in the
priest, with cowl and satin vestments, kneeling before a wooden
cross, on his way to the place of prayer; in the peasant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
as he performed his rural labors, attended by his wife and
playful children; in the rude Indians, with fantastic costumes,
who were wont to play their uncouth games on the green-sward,
or perform their dexterous feats in the bark canoe;
in the sky, which smiled perpetually upon the virgin wilderness;
and in that wilderness, whose peculiar features verily
blossomed as the unplucked rose. And there was poetry in
all that fell upon the ear: in the lowing of the cattle and
the tinkling of their bells; in the gentle flowing waters, and
the sound of the summer wind, as it sported with the forest
trees, and wandered away, laden with the perfume of nameless
flowers; in the singing of unnumbered birds, which
ascended to the skies in a perpetual anthem; and in the
loud clear laugh of French and Indian children, as they
mingled together in their simple games. But those patriarchal
days are for ever departed! In another part of the
country Tecumseh and Pontiac were beginning to figure in
successive battles against the United States, and their hostile
spirit soon manifested itself upon our frontier. The Indians
upon this river became the enemies of the settlers, which
turned out to be the prelude to a storm of war that scattered
death and desolation along its path. But many years have
fled since then, and the blessings of peace and prosperity are
resting upon our country.</p>
<p>The poor Indians have almost withered from the land,
and those French inhabitants, like all things earthly, are on
their way to the land of forgetfulness. Another race of men
succeeded here, and can be numbered by thousands; and
where once extended the dominion of the wilderness, a business
city now looks down upon the river, which river has
become an adopted servant of commerce.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from here quoting the following passage
from Charlevoix, descriptive of the scenery as it existed
when he passed through this region in seventeen hundred
and twenty-one:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first of June, being the day of Pentecost, after having
sailed up a beautiful river (the Raisin) for the space of
an hour, which has its rise, as they say, at a great distance,
and runs betwixt two fine meadows, we passed over a carrying
place of about sixty paces in breadth, in order to avoid
turning round a point which is called Long Point. It is a
very sandy spot of ground, and naturally bears a great quantity
of vines. The following days I saw nothing remarkable,
but coasted along a charming country, hid at times by disagreeable
prospects, which, however, are of no great extent.
Wherever I went ashore, I was enchanted by the beauty
and variety of a landscape, terminated by the noblest forests
in the whole world. Add to this, that every part of it swarms
with waterfowl. I cannot say whether the woods afford
game in equal profusion. Were we all to sail, as I there
did, with a serene sky, in a most charming climate, and in
water as clear as that of the purest fountain; were we sure
of finding every where as secure and agreeable places to
pass the night in; where we might enjoy the pleasures of
hunting at a small expense, breathe at our ease of the purest
air, and enjoy the prospect of the finest of countries; we
might be tempted to travel to the end of our days. How
many oaks represented to me that of Mamre! How many
fountains put me in mind of that of Jacob! Each day a new
situation, chosen at pleasure, a neat and commodious house
built and furnished with all necessaries in less than a quarter
of an hour, and floored with a pavement of flowers, continually
springing up on a carpet of the most beautiful green;&mdash;on
all sides simple and natural beauties, unadulterated and
inimitable by art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this region I spent my wild and wayward boyhood.
In the prime of summer I have watched for pigeons on the
margin of the forest springs; in the strangely beautiful
autumn and Indian summer I have captured the squirrel
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
and partridge; and in the winter the turkey and the deer.
Reader! have you ever, while roaming in the woods bordering
a prairie, startled from his heathery couch a noble buck,
and seen him dart from you, &ldquo;swift as an arrow from a
shivering bow!&rdquo; Was it not a sight worthy of a purer
world than ours? Did you not hail him &ldquo;king of the beautiful
and fleet&rdquo;?</p>
<p>There is one hunting incident which I met with when
about fourteen years of age, that I can never forget. I had
entered upon a cow-path, and as it led through so many and
such beautiful places, I forgot myself and wandered on until
the shadows of evening warned me of my situation. Great
oaks and hickories, and walnut trees were with me wherever
I went. They cast a spell upon me like that which is
wrought by the old of other days. The black night came
at last, and there I was, alone, and lost in that silent wilderness.
Onward still did I continue, and even in my great
fear was at times startled by the flapping of an owlet&rsquo;s wing
or the howl of a wolf. The stars were above, shining in
their brightness, but invisible to me, so closely woven were
the tops of the trees. Faintly glimmering in the distance, I
saw a firelight, and on coming near, found a party of Indians
encamped. My breast panted with excessive fear, and yet
I could not speak&mdash;could hardly breathe, and still my mind
was free and active. I stood and listened to the faint sound
of a distant waterfall. Would that I had power to express
the emotions that came like a flood pouring into my soul.
Covered by a blanket, and pillowed by a mocuck of sugar,
each Indian was asleep upon his rush-mat. Parents, children,
and friends, promiscuously disposed, though all of them
with their feet turned towards the expiring embers. The
dogs too, looking ferocious and cunning as wolves, were all
sound asleep. I stole softly into the midst of the wild company,
and covering myself with an odd blanket, strange to
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
say, I slumbered. When morning was come, and the Indians
discovered a pale-faced boy among them, their astonishment
can be more easily conceived than described. I at
length informed them by signs that I was lost, and that my
home was in the village of Monroe. I partook with them of
a hearty breakfast, composed of venison, hommony, and
water, and ere the sun had mounted high, was on my way
homeward, with an Indian for my guide. As we parted on
the outskirts of the village, I offered to pay him for his trouble,
but he declined receiving any thing. I turned around,
and the thick forest shielded him from my sight. Of course
my friends were much concerned at my absence, and the
majority of them insisted upon my having been drowned.
For one whole week after this adventure, I was compelled
to stay at home; but after that, it was forgotten, and I was
in the forests again.</p>
<p>But my heart-song of other days is just beginning, and I
cannot yet drop my pen. My father&rsquo;s residence was upon
one of the old French farms, that were once so famous for
their Arcadian beauty. The hand of improvement has despoiled
them of their original glory, and the strange, gaudy
scenes that I now behold, only tend to oppress my spirit with
gloom. The city dwellings around me I cannot see, for my
mind is upon the village of my birth. The farm alluded to
above, was about half a mile in width, and extended back to
the distance of nearly two miles. Leaving the river and
going back, you first pass through an orchard containing four
or five hundred trees. Here a row of splendid pear-trees,
and there a regiment of old black apple-trees, staggering
under their weight of fruit. Entering a little enclosure
behind a barn, you might see fifty small light-green trees,
with an innumerable number of rosy-cheeked peaches under
their leaves. And now we pass the great cider-press,
where I was wont to imbibe the rich American wine through
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
an oaten straw. A little further on, we come to a green
pasture, where there are cows, oxen, sheep and horses grazing;
onward still, and a wheat-field, yellow as gold, bowing
before the breeze. Then our path lies across a pleasant
meadow, watered by a sparkling stream; and after a brief
walk we find ourselves in the forest, dark and gloomy.
And such was the spot where I spent the morning of my days.
Is it strange, then, that a deep and holy love for nature should
be rooted in my heart?</p>
<p>That description reminds me of another hunting expedition,
of which I would merely give an outline. It is early
morning, and the latter part of spring. Breakfast is ended.
My cap and buckskin shirt are on, the latter gathered round
my waist by a scarlet worsted belt. My powder-horn and
shot-pouch are filled with the nicest kind of ammunition, and
in my hand is my valued little gun, (bought expressly for
myself,) polished bright as a sunbeam. I have kissed the
baby, and am now on my winding way. At the mouth of
the river, I borrow a canoe of some old Frenchman who
resides there. If I were to offer him pay he would not
accept it; for the interesting reason that he &ldquo;knows my
father.&rdquo;&mdash;All the day long have I been hunting, and revelling
in a dream-land of my own. The sun is in the west, and I
am hungry. I have paddled around many a green and
lovely island, and explored many a bayou and marsh, and outlets
of creeks; frightening from her lonely nest many a wild-duck
and her brood. My shot-pouch is now empty, although
the bottom of my canoe is covered with game. There are
five canvass-backs, three teals, three plovers, two snipes, one
wood-duck, and other kinds of waterfowl. The canoe is
drawn up on shore, and with my thanks I have given old
Robert a couple of ducks. My game is now slung upon my
back, and I am homeward bound, proud as a young king.
While passing through the village, (for I have to do so,) I
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
hear a voice exclaiming, Lally! Lally! I approach, and
find my father and several other gentlemen seated at the
post-office door talking politics. Each one in turn gives me
a word of praise, calling me &lsquo;quite a hunter.&rsquo; I pay them
for their kindness on the spot, by the donation of a canvass-back,
and pass on.</p>
<p>That evening my supper is a rare enjoyment, for some
of the ducks have been cooked under the especial charge of
my mother. A little longer, and I am in the land of dreams.
Many, very many such days have I enjoyed, but now they
are far from me. Oh! that I were an innocent, laughing,
happy boy once more! Come back! Come back! joys of
my youth!</p>
<p>Fishing is another art in which I was considered an
adept. When the first warm days lured the sturgeon and
muskalounge from their deep home in the bosom of the lake,
to ascend the Raisin, I was always among the first on the
large platform below a certain milldam, (now all washed
away,) with spear in hand and heart to conquer. Many a
noble sturgeon, six and seven feet long, have I seen extended
on the shore. As for <i>me</i>, I never <i>aimed</i> only at the smaller
ones. Once, however, my spear entered the back of a
&ldquo;<i>whapper</i>,&rdquo; and my determination to keep hold was nearly
the cause of my being drowned. It must have been a thrilling,
yet a ridiculous sight, to see me a-straddle of the fellow,
and passing down the river like lightning. I think if Mr.
William Shakspeare had been present, he would have exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Lo,
a mer-<i>man</i> on a <i>sturgeon&rsquo;s</i> back!&rdquo; If I
could enjoy such sport now with the feelings of my boyhood,
I would willingly risk such a ducking every day. But I am
now a struggler amid the waves of life. O, how many long
and never-to-be-forgotten Saturday afternoons, have I mused
away on the margin of my native stream. How many perch,
and bass, sun-fish, and pike, and pickerel, have I brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
from their pure element to place upon my father&rsquo;s table!
But those days are for ever departed, all and for ever&mdash;gone
into their graves, bearing with them all my dreams, all my
hopes and fond anticipations. Desolate indeed does it make
my heart, to look upon the changes that have taken place in
the home of my boyhood. Kind words do indeed fall upon
my ear, but I <i>feel</i> myself to be a stranger or as one forgotten.
O, I <i>am</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A homeless wanderer through my early home;</p>
<p class="t0">Gone childhood&rsquo;s joys, and not a joy to come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr"><i>Dana.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But let me, while I may, recall a few more bright visions
from the past.</p>
<p>Aye, even now into the chambers of my soul are entering
an array of winter pictures, associated with the times of the
days of old.</p>
<p>True as memory itself, by every thing that meets the eye
of my fancy, I perceive that winter has asserted his empire
over my native village. Once more am I a bounding and
happy boy, and planning a thousand excursions to enjoy the
merry season. The years, between the present and that
happy time, are vanished into forgetfulness, and it seemeth
to me that I am even now panting with the excitement of a
recent battle in the snow.</p>
<p>Last night, so my fancy tells me, there was a heavy fall
of the white element. This morning, while walking along
one of the streets of the village, a snow-ball hit me on the
back, whereupon I jumped into an attitude of defiance. Partly
hidden by a neighboring fence, I discover a group of roguish
boys, whom I immediately favor with an answer to
their salute. Eight is the number of my temporary enemies,
and as they leap the fence and come into full view, my
heart begins to quail, and I feel a scampering sensation in
my <i>heels</i>. Just in the &ldquo;nick of time,&rdquo; however, half a dozen
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
of my friends who happen along, come to my relief, when
a couple of shouts ascend to heaven, and the battle commences.
Round, hard, swiftly thrown, and well-aimed are
the balls that fly. Already, from many a window, fair and
smiling spectators are looking upon us, and each one of us
fancies himself to be another Ivanhoe. The combat deepens.
One fellow receives a ball directly in the ear, and away he
reels &ldquo;with a short uneasy motion,&rdquo; and another has received
one in his belly, probably making still flatter the pancakes
that are there. And then, as a stream of blood issues from the
smeller of one, and the eyes of another are made to see stars,
a maddening frenzy seizes upon the whole gang&mdash;the parties
clinch,&mdash;and the &ldquo;rubbing&rdquo; scene is in its prime, with its
struggles and sounds of suffering. One poor fellow is pitched
into a snow-drift, heels over head, while his enemy almost
smothers him with hands-full of soft snow, causing his writhing
countenance to glisten with a crimson hue; another, who
had been yelling at a tremendous rate over a temporary triumph,
is suddenly attacked by a couple of our party, who
pelt him furiously, until he cries out most lustily&mdash;&ldquo;I beg,
I beg,&rdquo; when he is permitted to retire with his laurels. One
chap receives a stinger of a blow between his peepers, accompanied
by an oath, whereupon we know that there is too
much passion in the fray, and while the victims enter upon a
regular fisticuff, we find it necessary to run to their rescue
and separate them. Thus the general battle ceases. After
coming together, declaring ourselves good friends, and talking
over the struggle, we collect our scattered caps, mittens, and
tippets, and quietly retire to our respective homes.</p>
<p>Time flies on,&mdash;we have had a protracted rain, the streets
have been muddy, the people dull,&mdash;but now fair weather cometh
out of the north, and the beautiful River Raisin is again
sheeted in its icy mail. For a week past great preparations
have been made by some two dozen boys for a skating excursion
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
to a certain light-house on Lake Erie, situated about
ten miles from Monroe. We have seen that our skates are
in first-rate order, and Tom Brown (an ancient negro who
was the &ldquo;guide, counsellor, and friend&rdquo; of every Monroe boy)
has promised to awaken us all, and usher in the eventful
morning by a blast from his old tin horn; so that when bedtime
comes, we have nothing to do but say our prayers and
enjoy a refreshing sleep. Strange, that I should remember
these trifling events so distinctly! But there they are, deeply
and for ever engraven on the tablet of my memory, together
with thousands of others of a kindred character. Their exalted
mission is to cheer my heart amid the perplexities of
the world.</p>
<p>It is the break of day, and bitter cold. The appointed
signal hath been given;&mdash;the various dreams of many a
happy youth are departed; each one hath partaken of a
hearty breakfast, and the whole party are now assembled
upon the ice &ldquo;below the bridge.&rdquo; Then follows the bustle
of preparation. While some are tardy in buckling on their
skates, others slap their hands together to keep them warm,
while some of the smartest and most impatient <i>rogues</i> are
cutting their names, or certain fantastic figures, as a prelude
to what we may expect from them in the way of fine skating.
Presently we are drawn up in a line to listen to the parting
words of &ldquo;Snowball Tom.&rdquo; At the conclusion of his speech,
a long and loud blast issues from the old tin horn, which we
answer by a laugh and a louder shout, and like a band of
unbroken colts, we spring to the race upon the icy plain.
Away, away, away. Long and regular are the sweeps we take,
and how dolefully does the poor river groan as the ice cracks
from shore to shore, as we flee over its surface &ldquo;like a rushing
mighty wind!&rdquo; Keen, and piercingly cold is the morning
breeze, but what matter? Is not the blood of health and
happy boyhood coursing through our veins? Now we glide
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
along the shore, frightening a lot of cattle driven to the
river by a boy, or the horses of some farmer who is giving
them their morning drink; now we pass the picturesque
abodes of the Canadian peasantry, partly hidden by venerable
trees, though now stripped of their leafy honors; now
we give chase to a surprised dog returning from the midnight
assassination of some helpless sheep; now we pass the last
vestige of humanity upon the river, which is the log cabin of
an old French fisherman and hunter; and now we pass a
group of little islands with a thick coating of snow upon their
bosoms, and their ten thousand beautiful bushes and trees
<i>whispering</i> to the air of the surrounding silence. Already
have we more than measured the distance of two leagues
outside of Pleasant Bay, and our course is now on the broad
bosom of Lake Erie, with an unbroken field of solid ice before
us far as the eye can reach. The frozen pavement
along which our skates are ringing is black as the element
beneath, and so transparent, that where the water is not more
than ten or twenty feet in depth, we can distinctly see sunken
logs, clusters of slimy rocks and herds of various kinds of
fish, balancing themselves in sleep or darting about their domain
in sport. But these delicious pictures are for some
other time,&mdash;we are speeding with the breeze and cannot
tarry. Away,&mdash;away,&mdash;away!</p>
<p>But what means that sudden wheel of our leader, as with
his voice and upraised hands he summons us to halt? Half
a mile on our lee, and about the same distance from the shore
he has just discovered an assembly of men, with their horses
and sleighs at a stand, as if preparing for a race. Without
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation we decide to be &ldquo;on hand,&rdquo; and in a
few minutes are cutting up our capers in the midst of a hundred
Canadians who are about to enjoy what we predicted. Beautiful
and fantastic carriolles are here, drawn by sleek and saucy-looking
Canadian pacers, and occupied by hard-fisted men
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
enveloped in their buffalo-robes, whom we recognize as friends.
Here we notice one Beaubien with his pony of glossy black,
which has never yet been beaten, and are told that the race
is to be between him and an entire stranger who has accepted
a recently made challenge. To the stranger we turn, and
find his horse to be a beautiful bay, and of a more delicate
build than the Canadian champion. The race is to be two
miles in length and the amount of the bet five hundred dollars.
All things being ready, the competitors move slowly to the
starting place with their witnesses, while the concourse of
people await in breathless anxiety the result of the race.
Hark! hear you not the clattering of hoofs, resounding far
over the plain, as if in search of an echo? Aye, and with
wondrous speed they are coming! How exciting is the scene!
In three minutes more the contest will be ended. See!&mdash;Beaubien
is ahead, and the victory undoubtedly his! But
now the stranger tosses up his cap, and as it falls, the flying
pacer understands the signal&mdash;he increases his already almost
matchless speed, he passes the Frenchman with a look
of triumph in his eye,&mdash;one minute more,&mdash;and the unknown
is triumphant. Most unexpected is the result. The people are
bewildered and perplexed, but when Beaubien delivers up the
lost money, not a word escapes him, and he seems to be
broken-hearted. His darling steed has been eclipsed, the
<i>swiftest</i> pacer in all the country does not belong to him, and
he is miserable. The sport ended, and not caring for the
jabbering of a band of excited Frenchmen, we come together
again, and continue on our course.</p>
<p>Another hour do we while away along the lake shore,
now pausing to get a little breath, and now gazing with curious
eyes into the gloomy forest (which comes to the very
water&rsquo;s edge) as we glide along. At twelve o&rsquo;clock we have
reached the desired haven, our feet are gladly released, and
we are the welcome guests of mine host of the light-house.
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
By some the peculiar features of the lonely place are examined,
while others, who have an eye for the grand in nature,
ascend to the top of the light-house for a view of the frozen
lake&mdash;reposing in unbroken solitude. The curiosity of all
being satisfied, we assemble in the comfortable parlor of
our entertainer, Mr. Whipple, and await the dinner-hour.
A jolly time then follows;&mdash;many a joke is cracked, and
many a twice-told legend of the wilderness related; a sumptuous
dinner is enjoyed; the evening hours approaching, we
begin to think of home, and by the time the heavens are
flooded with the light of the moon and stars, we have taken
our departure, and are upon our skates once more. Without
meeting with a single accident, elated by many a gay song
on our way, and with our thoughts mostly bent upon the
&ldquo;spacious firmament on high,&rdquo; we glide over the frozen
wave, and at the usual hour are in our warm beds, anticipating
a dream of those things, for which our several hearts are
panting.</p>
<p>Hardly a week has elapsed before we have another heavy
fall of snow, and the principal topic of conversation among
the young people of the village is a sleigh-ride. The boys,
about this time, are making themselves wonderfully useful
in their fathers&rsquo; stables, taking good care of the horses, examining
the sleighs, collecting the buffalo-robes and polishing
the bells; while the girls are busily engaged upon their
hoods, cloaks, muffs, and moccasons, and wondering by whom
they will be invited. The long-wished-for day has arrived.
Farewell&rsquo;s Tavern, ten miles up the River Raisin, is our place
of destination. The cheerful sun is only about an hour high,
when there is heard a merry jingling of bells in the village
streets. Our cavalcade numbers some half dozen well-filled
sleighs, and one single-seated carriolle occupied by Abby
Somebody and the Chief Marshal of the expedition,&mdash;the
writer of this rhapsody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>My black trotter was never in finer spirits, and it is as
much as I can do to hold him in, as with his neck beautifully
arched he bears upon the bit. He seems to know that his
youthful master has but one dearer friend upon earth, who
is the &ldquo;bonnie lassie&rdquo; at his side. Many and tender are the
words then spoken, and the wide world before our youthful
fancies is the home only of perpetual pleasures. Far, very
far from our minds are all the stern realities of life. We
hear the flail of the industrious farmer in his barn, but do not
dream of the great truth that mankind are born to labor and
grow old with trouble. We look upon a poverty-stricken
and forsaken Indian, with his family trudging across the
snowy landscape, and gratefully reflect upon the comforts of
our own homes, and sigh for the miseries of the poor. Youth
makes us forgetful of the <i>real</i> future, and the dawning of
love opens our hearts to every tender influence, and we resolve,
hereafter, to be very kind to the unfortunate. The
shades of evening are descending upon the earth, and with
thoughtfulness we gaze upon the quiet pictures of the road,
the season, and the hour. We pass a wooden cross with its
covering of snow, which was planted by Jesuit Missionaries
a century ago, and think of Him whom we have been rightly
taught to worship and adore. Farmers are foddering their
cattle, boys are carrying in huge armsful of dry hickory for
a roaring fire, and cheerful lights are gleaming from the
windows of the farm-houses as we pass along. Finally the
comfortable dwelling where we would be meets our gaze,
seeming to smile upon us, with its various lighted windows, and
clouds of smoke ascending heavenward, when, with a few
flourishes of whips, and a terrible din of bells, the sleighing
party comes to a halt before the tavern of friend Farewell.</p>
<p>The upper rooms of the dwelling are all ready for our
reception, and while the girls are ushered into them, the boys
are attending to the comforts of their faithful horses. In due
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
time, after we have arranged the preliminaries for a supper,
we join the girls again, and in solid body make our appearance
in the spacious ball-room. A musician is already
there, in the person of an ancient negro, who tells us that his
fiddle is in prime order. But <i>dancing</i> is an idea of which
we had not dreamed, for we are utterly ignorant of the polite
accomplishment. But music we are resolved to have, and
doubt not but it will greatly add to our enjoyment of the various
games which we purpose to play. Now have the happy
voices of the party risen to a noisy height, as we take hold of
hands and commence the game of Drop the Handkerchief,
while many a race around the slippery floor is run, and
many a sweet kiss is given and returned. Then succeeds
the play of Button, wherein the forfeits are redeemed by
making &ldquo;wheelbarrows,&rdquo; &ldquo;measuring tape and cutting it
off,&rdquo; and by &ldquo;bowing to the wittiest, kneeling to the prettiest,
and kissing the one we love best.&rdquo; Then the stories
of the Stage-Coach have their turn, which create a perfect
tumult of laughter. After which we have Blindman&rsquo;s Buff,
and one poor creature after another is made to grope about
the room in Egyptian darkness. Such are the plays, with
many more of like character, which we enjoy, while our sable
friend is straining away at his old fiddle, as if determined
to be heard above the surrounding clamor of talking, laughing,
and singing voices.</p>
<p>The supper hour having arrived, a general adjournment
takes place, when the unnumbered good things of the table
are appropriated to their legitimate use. Half an hour is
then allotted to the young ladies to get ready, and by nine
o&rsquo;clock the sleighs are at the door, and after a delightful ride
of an hour in the clear moonlight, we are at our village homes,
and the memory of our sleigh-ride commencing its existence.</p>
<p>One, two, and perhaps three weeks have I been confined
at school, when the notion pops into my head that I must go
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
a-hunting, for my sporting friend, Francis Bannac (a Frenchman),
has told me that game is now quite abundant. My
father has granted me his permission, and Bannac tells me
that I may be his companion on a tramp of nine miles to the
head-waters of Plum Creek. A pack of wolves, of whose
depredations we have heard, are the principal game we have
in view. Having finished the usual preliminaries of a winter
hunt, and arrayed ourselves accordingly, we seize our rifles,
whistle to our greyhounds, and with the sun midway up the
heavens start upon the tramp. A walk of twenty minutes
brings us to the edge of the forest, where we strike an ancient
Indian trail and proceed on our way. A gorgeous landscape-panorama
is that through which we are passing, and
ourselves, I ween, the most <i>appropriate</i> and <i>picturesque</i> figures
that could be introduced. Foremost is the tall and sinewy
person of Bannac, with a snugly-fitted buckskin garment
tightened round his waist by a wampum belt, cowhide moccasons
on his feet, coonskin cap on his black head, pouch
and powder-horn, together with knife and tomahawk at his
side, and in his right hand a heavy rifle. Next to him trotteth
the deponent, who might be looked upon as a miniature
Bannac, with variations,&mdash;while a little in our rear are the
two hounds playing with each other, or standing still and
looking among the trees for game. All around us is a multitudinous
army of forest soldiers, from the youthful maple
or ash, to the rugged and storm-scathed oak or bass-wood;
and marvellously beautiful to my mind is the tracery of their
numberless branches against the blue sky, though my friend
would probably liken those very tree-tops to the head of some
&ldquo;loafer&rdquo; that had never made use of a comb. The earth is
covered with a thick coating of dead leaves, with here and
there a little island of snow. Now we perceive a beautiful
elm lodged in the giant branches of an old walnut, like a
child seeking consolation in the arms of its father; and now
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
we come to a deformed beech-tree, prostrate upon the earth,
with its uncouth roots wasting to decay, and the idea enters
my mind that such will eventually be the destiny of all Falsehood.
The woods in winter are indeed desolate. The green
leaves are no longer here to infuse into our hearts a portion
of their happiness, as they &ldquo;clap their hands in glee,&rdquo; and
the joyous birds of summer are not here to make melody in
their own hearts, as well as ours. True, that mosses of varied
hue and texture are on every side, and in their love enveloping
stumps, rocks, trunks, and branches, yet they remind
us of the pall and shroud. What footsteps do we hear, and
why do the hounds start so suddenly? We have frightened
a noble buck; but a moment has elapsed and he is beyond
our reach. The hounds, however, are close behind him
already, and the three are bounding away in splendid style,
illustrating to perfection the poetry of motion. We fancy
that the race will be a short one, and therefore start in the
pursuit, managing to keep in sight of our game. Heavens!
what a leap that was over those fallen trees! but the hounds
have done their duty, and the course is once more clear. A
lot of ravens far up in the upper air seem to be watching our
movements, as if hoping for a meal of venison,&mdash;and a gray
eagle flies screaming across our path, as if to mock us for
being without wings. Glossy black squirrels peep out of
their holes in wonder at the commotion, and a flock of wild
turkeys which we have alarmed, are running from us in
great confusion, like a company of militia before a cavalcade
of horsemen. But see! the buck has turned upon his pursuers,
and while they are battling together we have time to
approach within gun-shot. Quicker than thought Bannac
raises his rifle, a sharp report follows, a bullet has dropped
the forest king, and he must die. We skin him, secure the
two hams, and after examining our compass, and finding that
we are near our place of destination, shoulder our plunder
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
as best we may, and make a bee-line for the log cabin of our
intended host, where we arrive in due time, and exchange
friendly congratulations.</p>
<p>Well, now that we are here, I must give a brief description
of the man whose guests we are, and of the lonely place
which he inhabits. Like my bachelor friend, Bannac, Antoine
Campau is a Frenchman and a hunter, but a widower,
and the father of two little girls, and a strapping boy of fifteen.
A singular love of <i>freedom</i> first prompted him to leave
the settlement where he once lived, and to locate himself in
the woods, where, between a little farming and a good deal
of hunting, he manages to support himself and family quite
comfortably. His dwelling is a rusty-looking log house,
situated on a pleasant little stream, in the centre of a dead
clearing some three acres wide. The live stock of this embryo
farm consists of a cow, one yoke of oxen, a pony, a few
sheep, about three dozen hens, and a number of foxy-looking
dogs. And now that the long winter evening has set in,
and as the whole family is present, I will picture the interior
of our cabin. The only room, excepting the garret, is an
oblong square twenty feet by fifteen. The unboarded walls,
by the smoke of years, have been changed into a rich mahogany
brown. The only light in the room is that which
proceeds from an immense fireplace, where nearly a common
cart-load of wood is burning, and hissing, and crackling at
its own free will, so that the remotest corners are made cheerful
by the crimson glow. The principal articles of furniture
are a bed, one large table standing in the centre of the floor,
and some half dozen rush-chairs, while in one corner stands
a number of shot-guns and rifles, and a ladder leading to the
loft, and from the rafters above are hanging pouches, powder-horns,
leggins, a brace of wild ducks, one or two deer-hams,
and a bundle of dressed skins. The dogs of the family,
numbering only four, together with their dandy visitors,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
are scattered about the room,&mdash;one lying upon the hearth
and watching the fire, one playing with his shadow, another
walking thoughtfully across the floor, and the other
sound asleep. A bountiful supper having been prepared by
the daughters, the whole family, with their guests, are seated
at the table, and all past sorrows and future anxieties are forgotten
in the enjoyment of the passing hour. Bannac and
Campau have all the talking to themselves, as they have to
relate their manifold adventures and wonderful escapes,
wherein they make use of no less than three languages&mdash;bad
French, broken English, and genuine Potawattomee.
The leisure hour following supper is devoted principally to
the cleaning of our rifles, the moulding of bullets, and other
matters preliminary to the capture of a few wolves.</p>
<p>For the novel mode which we are to pursue on this occasion,
we are indebted to our friend Campau, and he tells us
it will positively prove successful. From his account it appears
that only a few evenings ago his sheep were attacked
by the wolves, and before he could run to their rescue, one
of them was killed, but the thieves were compelled to part
with it, or run the risk of losing their lives. To-day Campau
has built a large pen, wherein he has placed the dead
sheep as a kind of bait. His idea is that the wolves will of
course revisit this spot to-night, and when they are in the act
of climbing over into the pen, we, who are to be hidden
within gun-shot, will give them the cold lead. Behold us
then at the midnight hour in our treacherous ambush.</p>
<p>Listen! Hear you not the dismal shriek of an owl? Our
enemies must be coming, for their footsteps have disturbed
the feathered hermit, as he sat upon a limb with a red squirrel
in his claw. Yes, there they are, the prowling thieves,
just without the shadow of the wood, dodging along between
the blackened stumps of the clearing. There are five of
them, and see! with what activity they leap into the fold!
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
Now is our time to settle them. We rush forward with a
shout, when the villains commence a retreat, and as they
mount the high enclosure, we succeed in shooting three,
while the other two escape unharmed. The dead culprits
having been stripped of their hides, their carcasses are carried
away and exposed for food to the vulture and eagle.
We then return to our cabin and sleep until late in the morning,
when we are surprised to find that a regular snow-storm
has set in. Our sporting for to-day, which was to have
been of a miscellaneous character, is given up, and Bannac
thinks it better that he and I should turn our faces homeward
in spite of the storm. Whereupon, after a good breakfast,
we take leave of our hospitable friends, and through the
falling snow, enter the forest on our return.</p>
<p>Snow, snow, snow,&mdash;above us, around us, and under our
feet, to the depth of some half dozen inches. In large feathery
flakes it floats downward through the still air, and it also
muffles our footsteps as we tramp through the pathless and
desolate woods. Every thing that meets the eye is enveloped
in a downy covering: not only the prostrate and decayed
tree, but the &ldquo;topmost twig that looks up at the sky.&rdquo;
Slowly and heavily, without game, or a single adventure, we
are compelled to trudge along, and when we come in sight
of the pleasant village, not a penny care we for any thing
else in this world, but a roaring fire and a warm supper,&mdash;both
of which in my father&rsquo;s dwelling are we presently permitted
to enjoy&mdash;and thus endeth another portion of my heart-song.</p>
<p>Among the peculiar characters which I remember, while
thinking upon my early days, none do I dwell upon with
more pleasurable feeling than an old Indian. My first acquaintance
with him took place when I was about twelve
years old. It was the pleasant summer-time. At an early
hour of the day I had launched my little birch canoe from
the sloping bank behind our orchard, and, accompanied by
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
Rover, started on a duck hunt down the river Raisin. I
would here remark, that the mouth of this beautiful river is
studded with islands, and has been, from time immemorial,
celebrated for its abundance of game. As I paddled along,
I watched with an inward joy the progress of the morning.
The farm-houses that had been long sleeping amid the
silence of night, were now enlivened by their inmates, who
had sallied forth to perform their allotted duties. At one
moment my ears were saluted by a chorus of voices from
some neighboring poultry-yard, mingled with the lowing of
cows and the jingling of bells in the sheepfold. And then
I heard the singing of larks in the open fields, the neighing
of a horse, or the shout of some happy boy. The mists,
frightened by the sunbeams, were rising from the river, and
from the trees on either side the dew was falling. I looked
upon the changing landscape, smiling in its freshness, and
felt my heart swell within me, for I beheld the glory and
goodness of God, and I &ldquo;blessed him unaware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ducks were very shy that day, and the few that I
did shoot were taken on the wing. I was about making up
my mind to return home, when I beheld a single canvass-back
rise from the water in the distance, and, seemingly
unconscious of my presence, fly directly over my head. I
fired at it, and the feathers flew. Slowly but surely the
bird descended, and at last fell upon an island a quarter of
a mile away. This was soon reached, and a long hour did
I search for my game among the bushes and grass, but I
sought in vain. This island was about two furlongs in
length and one in width. At one end was a group of lofty
sycamores, and at the other three black pines stood together,
like robbers plotting the destruction of an enemy. Between
and beneath these, the dark-green and luxuriant foliage of
less ambitious trees formed to all appearance a solid mass.
Here the light-green ivy encircled some youthful ash, from
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
whose top it wandered among the limbs of other trees; and
there, the clustering fruit hung in great abundance from the
brown grape-vine. While rambling about this island, I discovered
in its centre a little clearing or miniature prairie,
on which stood a single wigwam. A wreath of smoke rose
from its chimney between the trees, gracefully curling upward
to the sky. I entered the hut, and beheld the form of
an Indian, who was engaged in cooking his noonday meal.
At first he was surprised at my presence, but when I told
him I was merely on a hunting excursion, his countenance
changed, and he manifested much pleasure. His kindness
and my boyish familiarity conspired to make us soon acquainted.
He was a tall, athletic, well-proportioned man,
with dark eagle eyes. His long locks of hair were now
whitening with age. I will not dwell upon the particulars
of that interview. Let it suffice to know that I departed
from that &ldquo;green and lovely isle,&rdquo; feeling that I had a
friend in the person of that old Indian.</p>
<p>Many a day, during that summer and the ensuing
autumn, did I spend in his society. Many a table luxury
brought I to his lonely dwelling. Many a lesson has he
taught me, in the arts of fishing and hunting. Long years
have flown since then. But the wild and pure enjoyments
which I then participated in with this old Indian, are deeply
engraven on the tablet of my memory.</p>
<p>We used often to enter our respective canoes and explore
the neighboring creeks and rivers, little islands of the bay,
and others far out into the lake. We would bathe together,
at one time wading out from the sandy and sloping shore,
and again leaping and diving from some abrupt headland
into the clear water, so clear and pure that the shells upon
the bottom were distinctly seen at the depth of twenty feet
or more. I never troubled myself about the origin of this
old Indian. His name, to what nation he belonged, or his
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
reasons for thus living alone, were things that I never
desired to know. I was content to be with him, and during
our various excursions, to listen to his wild legends, his narratives
of strange adventures and exploits, which he would
recount in broken English, though always with the eloquence
of nature. Ofttimes I could not comprehend his meaning,
more especially when he described the beauties of the Spirit
Land, which he said existed far beyond the setting sun; and
also when he told me of its valleys, and mountains, and
forests, smiling under the influence of perpetual summer,
where the singing of birds was always heard, and where the
buffalo, the horse, the deer, the antelope, the bear, the wolf,
the panther, the muskrat, and otter, flourished and fattened
for its inhabitants.</p>
<p>When we looked upon the lurid lightning, and listened
to the sullen roar of the distant thunder, he would raise his
hands to heaven, exclaiming, &ldquo;the Great Spirit is angry,&rdquo;
and kneeling down, would kiss the ground in fear and adoration.
Pleasantly indeed did the days of that summer, and
the ensuing autumn, pass away. At last winter came, and
the waters of the ever-murmuring Raisin were clasped in
his icy chains. In a little time I lost sight of my old friend,
for his island home was desolate,&mdash;he had departed,&mdash;no one
knew where. Spring came, and I was sent to an eastern
city to school. Five years were flown, and I returned to
the village of my birth. At the twilight hour a few evenings
after this, I was seated at an open window with my
mother, inhaling the fragrance of blowing flowers, and at
times listening to the mellow tones of the sweet whippoorwill.
All the important incidents that had transpired
during my absence, were affectionately and particularly
related. Nothing, however, interested me so much as the
following brief account of my old Indian friend, which I
now write down in the words in which it was told me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;The summer after you left us, an Indian made his appearance
in our village, whose poverty and old age elicited
the kind sympathies and good wishes of all who knew him.
Nothing was known of his history, save that he belonged to a
tribe of Potawattomees, a nation at this period almost extinct.
Alas! for the poor aborigines of our country! To
them the earth is a dreary place, and their only joy is in the
hope that they will soon join their kindred in the land of
spirits. One by one, like the lingering sands of an hourglass,
they are passing beyond the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I heard you talk about an Indian, with whom you
had become acquainted while hunting, I thought this new
comer might be the identical one. While passing through
the village one day, I happened to meet him, and invited him
to come and sup with us that evening. He did so; and we
were very glad to hear that he was indeed your friend,
whom you thought dead. We discovered this fact from the
manner in which he spoke of a boy hunter, who used to
visit him in his lonely home. From that day he became
our particular friend, as he had been before the friend of
the whole village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His dress was common, but in the true Indian style.
He was ever a great favorite among the boys, in whose
sports he often participated. It was his custom in summer to
sit beneath the great elm-tree on the green, and, gathering the
children around him, rehearse to them wild stories about
the red men of the forest. Sometimes he would spend a
whole day in whittling out bows and arrows for his youthful
friends; and they in return would bestow on him various
little presents, both curious and rare. He had no particular
abiding place. There were a dozen houses where he was
perfectly at home. He seldom alluded to his tribe, and
never ventured beyond the limits of the county. This was
indeed unaccountable; but as he seemed to possess so amiable
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
a disposition, no one could believe he had ever been
guilty of a crime. Rather than this, it was thought he had
been banished from his nation on account of some failure in
warlike exploits, or some similar cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, again, he was an Indian philosopher or
poet, who had unfortunately drawn upon himself the ill-will
of his people, by expressing some unpopular opinion. At
times he would enter the school-house, and listen attentively
to the boys reciting their lessons. A printed book he looked
upon as a treasure, and when one was given him, considered
it a sacred gift, though its contents he could not
read. He would often enter the church on the Sabbath, and
in his seat near the pulpit, with his head resting upon both
hands, would listen, with an anxious gaze, to the preacher&rsquo;s
words. He always left the house in a pensive mood.
To his mind the heaven of the Christian was utterly incomprehensible.
Of all the truths that were read to him from
the Bible, the most interesting and wonderful was the history
of our Saviour. When listening to this, he would often
clasp his hands in an ecstasy of delight, exclaiming, &lsquo;How
good man! how good man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On all occasions of festivity he was a welcome guest.
Christmas and New Year were always happy days with
him. The little girls invited him to their pic-nic parties.
The boys on Saturday afternoon had him to keep tally when
they were playing ball. He was always the leader of the
nutting-parties in autumn, and a participator in the sleigh-rides
of winter. In fact, he was every where, and had a
hand in almost every thing that transpired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six weeks ago it was reported throughout the
village that our old Indian friend was very sick, and at the
point of death. The intelligence was no less unexpected
than melancholy. He had so completely won the affection
of every body, that it spread a universal gloom. In a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
days he yielded up his spirit to his Father and his God.
The next day was the Sabbath, and the one appointed for
his burial. The sky was without a cloud, and the cool
breeze, as it rustled among the leaves, brought health and
refreshment to the body and soul of every one. The meadow-lark,
and woodland birds sang louder and sweeter than
they were wont to do.&mdash;A good man had died, and Nature,
animate and inanimate, seemed anxious to pronounce his
requiem. A larger funeral than this I have seldom seen.
Old men and women, young men and maidens, and little
children, with tearful eyes followed the old Indian to his
grave. It is situated in the northeast corner of the burying
ground, in the shadow of two weeping-willows, that seem
the guardians of his silent resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following morning, an hour before sunset, I stood
beside the clay cottage of my Indian friend. Green was the
grass, and many and beautiful the flowers that flourished
above his grave. I plucked a single harebell and placed it
in my bosom, and its sister flowers I watered with my tears.
Those tears, which were not the offspring of corroding grief,
but of a mournful joy, were the only tribute that I could pay
to one whom I dearly loved,&mdash;who was born a benighted
heathen, but who died a Christian. The mildly beaming
and beautiful evening star had risen in the west, ere I departed
from the &ldquo;Silent City;&rdquo; but I felt that the flower I
had plucked, though faded, would in after hours remind me
of my friend, and I therefore came away in peace, repeating
to myself these words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And I am glad that he has lived thus long,</p>
<p class="t0">And glad that he has gone to his reward;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor deem that kindly Nature did him wrong,</p>
<p class="t0">Softly to disengage the vital cord.</p>
<p class="t0">When his weak hand grew palsied, and his eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Dark with the mists of age, it was his time to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr"><i>Bryant.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>And now comes the conclusion of my long rhapsody.
The time of my departure for my distant city home is at
hand. A few more wilderness pictures, illustrative of my
native state as it was in other days, and I will lay aside my
pen.</p>
<p>Weary with the hunt, I lately sought the shady side of a
gentle hill, and extending my limbs upon the green-sward
amused myself by watching the sky. I gazed upon the blue
canopy, and fancied it to be an ocean, beyond which the
broad and beautiful fields of heaven were basking beneath
the smiles of God. A few white feather-clouds were floating
there, and they seemed to me to be a fleet returning from
their home of peace. In the dark regions of night they had
fought and conquered the enemy, and now, laden with redeemed
souls, were hastening to the haven of eternal rest.
Fancy, which had pictured this image, was gone; I saw
nothing save an eagle playing above the trees of the forest,
and in a moment I was a dreamer.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that I entered the forest just as the glorious
summer sun was sinking to his repose. The evening
star rose in the west, and in a little while from the zenith a
thousand other bright constellations looked smilingly down
upon the earth. Something whispered me that I must spend
the long watches of that night in wandering in the wilderness;
and I departed with the silence of a shadow, and the
speed of an antelope. Strange, and wild, and beautiful,
were the scenes I beheld.</p>
<p>The mighty trees which rose on every side seemed like
the columns of a vast temple, whose mysterious winding
aisles, overhung with a multitudinous foliage, were deserted
and desolate. No moving objects met my eye, save the fire-flies
that darted in all directions, floating and sinking like
burning flakes of snow. The gloomy silence was broken
only by the chirp of the cricket, and the song of the katy-did.
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
At intervals, too, the clear soothing voice of the whippoorwill
would echo far and near. The huge masses of foliage
above, reminded me of thunder-clouds, and like them
oppressed my spirit; and it was so still that &ldquo;the dropping
dew woke startling echoes in the sleeping wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My pathway was not smooth, for I was forced to leap,
now over some dead tree, and now over a pile of brush; and
again over a mossy hillock, or some gurgling brooklet. Ever
and anon I caught a glimpse of the deep blue sky; but in a
moment it was lost to view, and I was in total darkness. My
vision was wonderful. I saw all surrounding objects with
intense clearness; for to me the &ldquo;darkness was as the light
of day.&rdquo; At times I paused to listen, startled by some distant
sound; the howl of a wolf, the hooting of an owl, or
the &ldquo;trumpet-tone&rdquo; of a flying swan; and as I listened, it
would become a murmur, then a whisper, and at last die
into a breathless stillness.</p>
<p>At the foot of a gnarled and stunted oak I saw the manly
form of an Indian, wrapped in his scarlet blanket, and extended
upon a bearskin. He was fast asleep. On one side
of him, and within his reach, lay a bundle of arrows, and an
unstrung bow; on the other, a knapsack of provisions and a
wolfish-looking dog. But this guardian of the slumbering
savage was also fast asleep. As I looked upon this simple
picture, the feelings of my heart responded to my thoughts,
and I exclaimed, though there was no echo to my words:
&ldquo;Poor lone Indian! Is that dog thy only friend? Art thou
indeed alone in the wide, wide world? Hast thou no wife
to sympathize with thee, to love thee, in those hours of disappointment
and troubles incident to human life? No children
to play around thy knees, and make thee happy in some
comfortable wigwam, when the blue and scarlet birds make
melody in summer, and the wind Euroclydon howls and roars
among the forest trees in winter? Hast thou no daughter to
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
protect and cherish, that she may be the bride of some future
warrior? No son to listen, with flashing eye, to thy hunting
lessons; to smite his breast with pride and anger as thou
tellest him of the bravery and wrongs of thy ancestors? O
that I knew thy history! But I will not disturb thy slumber.
May thy dreams be of that land beyond the sunset clouds,
where perpetual summer reigns,&mdash;the land of the Great
Spirit,&mdash;the God of thy fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How vividly do the scenes and incidents of that night rise
before my vision! I see them now with the same distinctness
that I beheld them then. I stand upon the shore of that dark
stream, rolling through the dense woods, where the full blaze
of daylight has not penetrated for centuries. I hear that
uncouth but solemn funeral hymn, and see a band of stern
red men performing their mysterious rites over the grave of
an aged chieftain.</p>
<p>Not less sudden than varied are the scenes I behold. On
that high dry limb, under a canopy of leaves, a flock of turkeys
are roosting. They are all asleep save one, and he
is acting the part of a sentinel, darting out his long neck,
now this way, now that, as if he beheld an enemy. Fat,
sleepy fellow! There was a time when it would have been
temerity to look at me thus. I am not a hunter now, else
would I bring you down from your lofty resting-place.</p>
<p>My course is onward. Hark! I hear a yell, and a rushing
sound. Two wolves are chasing a beautiful doe. Poor
creature! Its strength is already lessening, its race is run.
The wolves have seized it. There is a struggle; the blood
issues from her graceful neck; one gasp more and the tender
mother of two sweet fawns lies dead. Its bones will
moulder and mingle with the earth, giving nourishment to
that cluster of hazel-bushes, which stand beside her mossy
death-bed. Awakened by the scent, a croaking raven is
wheeling in the distance. Its wings flap heavily, and there
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
are two, and still another! See! we come to a kind of opening,&mdash;a
place where the trees grow less closely together. A
cloud of thin white smoke is rising, as if from yonder pile of
underbrush. It is an Indian encampment; a dozen bark wigwams,
shaped like a sugar-loaf. But why this bustle, at so
late an hour? The men have just returned from a three
days&rsquo; hunting tour, and they are now releasing their pack-horses
from their loads of spoil. The blaze from a fire gives
all surrounding objects a ruddy glow. In dire confusion upon
the ground lie haunches of venison, red and gray squirrels
and racoons, turkeys, grouse, ducks, pheasants, and many
other lesser birds, mingled with guns, bows and arrows, shot-pouches,
powder-horns, skins, halters, brass kettles, and the
like. The men are busy, and the women too. Roused from
a four hours&rsquo; nap, several children are coming out from their
tents, rubbing their eyes. They seem to be the only playmates
of the whining dogs.</p>
<p>Lo! what a beauteous sight! A herd of deer reposing like
a family of wood-sprites, near yonder clump of young maples!
There are three bucks, five does, and two lovely
spotted fawns. Upon that decayed &ldquo;stump&rdquo; beyond, a solitary
American nightingale is resting. It is my favorite bird.
Would that I knew the cause of its complainings and chastisement,
for every now and then it utters forth the cry,
&ldquo;Why whip poor Will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What silver rays are those darting down through the
leafy bough? The moon! the moon! High in the heaven
she sails, in queenly beauty. The very heart of the forest
is not beyond her vivifying influence. Festoons of creeping
plants hang from the surrounding limbs; and the ivy and
grape-vine have twined themselves so closely around that
ash, as entirely to hide from view the bark of the trunk. I
thrust my hand against a bush, and a thousand dew-drops fall
to the earth, glittering in the moonbeams. If my lady-love
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
were with me, what a gorgeous wreath could I now weave
for her beautiful brow out of the purple and scarlet iris, the
blue larkspur, the moccason-flower, the crimson and green
lichen, and other mosses, flowers, and vines, too delicate to
have a name!</p>
<p>A gentle breeze is stirring. The tops of the trees are
moving to and fro with the strong but gentle motion of a
ground-swell. Soothing is the music of the leaves; they seem
to murmur with excess of joy. Another sound echoes
through the listening wilderness. It is but a scuffle between
a panther and bear. Let them growl and fight; who cares?
How like two hot-headed politicians they seem!</p>
<p>Again are the trees becoming thinner, and my steps are
tending downward. The green-sward I press is without a
single stick or bramble. Here I am upon the brink of a
little lake of the very purest water! The breeze has spent
its force, and every thing is still. It is &ldquo;the bridal hour of
the earth and sky!&rdquo; What a perfect mirror is this liquid
element! The counterpart of two willows, a grass-grown
rock, tall reeds, and beyond all, a row of slender elms, and a
lightning-shivered pine, are distinctly seen, pointing downward,
downward to the moon and stars, in the cerulean void
beneath. And in yon deep shadow a flock of ducks are
floating silently, amid the sweet perfume of the wild lotus
and white water-lily, which are growing near. One or two
have wandered out into the lake, making no ripple, but
moving as if lured away by the glossy loveliness of their
shadows. The same mysterious influence which has brought
me thus far, will transport me to the opposite shore.</p>
<p>I am there! yet still my course is &ldquo;onward.&rdquo; I am
come to a little lawn, so smooth and beautiful that it seems a
fit play-ground for the fairies. Perhaps it is here the water-spirits
and wood-nymphs are wont to meet, to revel and
rejoice at midnight, &ldquo;the dawn of the fairy day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>What sound is that!&mdash;so like the far-off tones of a hundred
musical instruments, faintly murmuring? Ah! I
thought so. Here they are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They come from beds of lichen green,</p>
<p class="t0">They creep from the mullen&rsquo;s velvet screen;</p>
<p class="t">Some on the backs of beetles fly,</p>
<p class="t0">From the silver tops of moon-touched trees,</p>
<p class="t">Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high,</p>
<p class="t0">And rocked about in the evening breeze;</p>
<p class="t">Some from the hum-bird&rsquo;s downy nest,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">They had driven him out by elfin power,</p>
<p class="t">And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast,</p>
<p class="t0">Have slumbered there till the charmed hour.</p>
<p class="t">Some had lain in the scoop of the rock,</p>
<p class="t0">With glittering izing-stars inlaid;</p>
<p class="t">And some had opened the four-o&rsquo;-clock</p>
<p class="t0">And stole within its purple shade.</p>
<p class="t">And now they throng the moonlight glade,</p>
<p class="t0">Above&mdash;below&mdash;on every side,</p>
<p class="t">Their little minim forms arrayed</p>
<p class="t0">In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr"><i>Drake.</i></p>
</div>
<p>That was but a flight of fancy. I look again, and instead
of the fairies, I behold a myriad of fair flowers, peeping
at the sky from the green luxuriant grass.</p>
<p>But see! I have reached&mdash;surely it can be none other&mdash;a
prairie! What dark cloud is brooding over this motionless
ocean?&mdash;a mighty flame bursting from its centre? It comes!
it comes! The prairie is on fire! The wind is rising, and
swift as the wind speed the flame-banners. Maddened by
fear, the buffalo, the wild horse, the wolf, the deer, birds,
and other living creatures, are fleeing for their lives. Roaring
and hissing the fire-flood rolls on, swallowing up every
thing in its course. And now it has gone, leaving behind it
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
a wide path of blackness. The smoke obscures the moon
and stars. &ldquo;Far-off its coming shone;&rdquo; the incense of a
sacrifice offered to the great God by the Earth, for some
enormous sin. But it is gone; and I resume my journey.</p>
<p>I am now in an open country of hills and dales. A narrow
but deep river is gliding by me in its pride and beauty.
Now it is lost to view by some abrupt headland, and anon it
makes a long sweep through a plain or meadow, its ripples
sporting in the moonlight. I hear the splash of fish, leaping
from their watery bed. I hear the measured stroke of a
paddle. It is an Indian in his birch canoe, passing down the
river. He has started a loon from his wavy cradle below
the rapids. I hear the sound of a waterfall. A mile away
there is a precipice, where the river gathers all its strength
for a fearful leap. Now its surface is without a ripple,&mdash;but
in a moment more, and it plunges down among the rocks,
and the waves struggle, and leap, and rise and sink, like demon-spirits
in agony.</p>
<p>I am standing on a hill which overlooks a lovely landscape
of woods and lawns, streams, hills, valleys, and cultivated
fields,&mdash;farm-houses and church-steeples. In the distance
sleep the bright-green waves of Lake Erie. A streak
of daylight is in the eastern sky. The spell is broken;&mdash;my
dream, and my book about the wilderness, are both
ended.</p>
